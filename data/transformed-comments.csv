Also seems to be a critique of how black culture contributes so much entertainment to society but the moment they step out of their lane theyÕre shut down, because theyÕre Òonly here for our amusementÓ. Also a critique of the violence beneath the surface of the Òwhite picket fencesÓ so to speak.",1
92,At the beginning where did he get the gun. Because when you see him from begin he has not gun in his back pocket or his wait and there was no outline of a gun inside his pants.

But it slowly zooms back into them. It's like he's saying that if we talk more about these issues that these colorful distractions (superficiality, vanity, glorifying violence in the community, or just seeming happy when you're not) can be seen past.Sadly it also seems to say that we only talk about these things for a moment and the distraction comes right back and we continue to do nothing.",0

What I can say is that what caught my eye is at the end of the song when he goes from aiming to an invisible gun to the smoking a blunt, he stands in a room full of empty cars from the 90's (i think.) What I got from that was that even though the laws have changed on certain things, in this case, weed and that black people have a richer life in comparison (at least numerically ""black man get your money"") , the feeling of the tense 90s racial divide and racial identity is live and prevalent even if the people have changed.",0

THEY TOOK THE ""SOUL"" OUT OF OUR CULTURE...WHAT THE F*CK HAPPENED TO ""SOUL MUSIC""?????? HERE'S HOW WE AS BLACKS START TO CHANGE FOR THE BETTER AND IT'S SIMPLE: WE NEED TO GO BACK TO LISTENING TO ALL OF OUR OLD R&B AND JAZZ MUSIC FROM THE 60'S, 70'S, AND 80'S. THIS MUSIC NOW HAS BEEN WEAPONIZED AND HAS DESTROYED A GENERATION, WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THE SOUL MUSIC. THE SAME WAY OUR ELDERS PLAYED THAT MUSIC WHEN WE WERE KIDS AND YOUNG, WE NEED TO DO THE SAME FOR TODAY'S YOUTH AS WELL AS US TOO. WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE... ALL OF THE WEALTHY BLACK FIGURES (BLACK MEN) ARE BEING ATTACKED SO THAT THEIR CHARACTER IS DESTROYED. ITS DEFINITELY NOT HARD TO SEE, AND THAT OJ SIMPSON SHIT LAST YEAR WAS JUST A PLOY TO GET THE RACIAL TENSION AT AN ALL TIME HIGH AGAIN. EVERYBODY START PASSING AROUND PLAYLISTS OF OLD SKOOL MUSIC TO FOLKS YOU KNOW. LETS MAKE IT LIKE A GAME...""I BET YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THIS CLASSIC"", THAT'S HOW WE START, BUT IT WILL TAKE MORE THAN THAT THO OBVIOUSLY. THE KEY IS OUR MUSIC, ITS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO TRULY INFLUENCE US TO THE POINT OF MANIPULATION.

This isn't a ""country"" problem though, it's a ""human"" problem that's been going on since the dawn of humanity. Humanity is fucked. We haven't evolved very much past our animal instincts, and likely never will. Rape, murder, abuse, theft, etc. will continue to happen no matter what you do. The quicker you learn to do deal with that fact and prepare for it, the better off you will be. Evil is real when it comes to humanity. You can't stop it. YOU will NEVER build a perfect society, because humanity isn't perfect in the slightest. Period, end of discussion. Now grow the fuck up and live your life, and try not to get murdered along the way.

338,"I believe  heÕs trying to show how black rappers are basically cooning to get paid and how the American entertainment industry only wants them to continue the mindless music that is harming their people.They sing get your money while he dances flamboyantly and spews lyrics talking about carrying guns, selling drugs, where designer clothes that are popular in todayÕs rap. HeÕs expressing while they make money and seemingly are having fun they are unaware or donÕt care about the chaos going on in the background to their people. He shoots the black man playing guitar in the beginning to represent how real music is being killed by this current trend in rap promoting idolizing clothes, money, drugs, and violence. Finally when he stops dancing/cooning, he is then chased down by whites to represent they are only interested in him continuing this cycle and will kill him or his career whenever he stops.",0

It's amazing that a dance that is considered to be an insult to our culture looks so damn badass when performed with soul. I've been doing this dance at work for two days now while I've been getting my money and listening to this song. Gambino is so freaking cool, man!___",0
364,"I think people attributing this to racism have the wrong idea. This video clearly shows not only the boiling tensions between races - which wasnÕt at all the focus, but rather the ignorance and flaws of black societies as a whole. The video begins with an opening or ÒprojectionÓ of what appeared to me as a black fatherly figure, holding an instrument. It showed a tranquil, calm and collected environment with history and culture. As soon as Gambino started dancing, the focus was taken away from the character, and the character was ÒBaggedÓ. He then used an ironic Jim Crowe stance, which under my interpretation, underlines the slavery and racism that existed which put these black stereotypes into place. Afterword, when he fires the weapon, the focus remains on him, the black rapper/performer/artist, not the crime heÕs committed. Next, we see black men and women in what appears to be school uniforms, representative of the upcoming youth and successful students in our country, actively helping and supporting these artists, demoralizing his crimes, instead focusing on his music and dance. Then, Gambino starts to dance with the group, however, when mentioning his ÒStrapÓ he firstly makes sure to look for the students and youth, as to not have them hear what heÕs saying. Almost as if he knows what he says as an artist will effect those younger and less successful, a shot towards the rappers and hip-hop artists of today who fire off these phrases without thinking of the repercussions. Next, the choir massacre, in all honesty, while I do believe this is representative of rappers undermining traditional values and rich culture of black communities, I have no specific supporting evidence of that claim. After this part, the dancing continues, alwhile your attention is focused on the students and upcoming youth, and their association with Gambino, while in the background a riot and large scale fighting is happening in the background. Lastly, to what I believe is an underlooked part, are the students finally not dancing, but recording Gambino with gang/symbolic masks on. I believe this is representative of the students doing what they should when in the light, but harboring hatred and personal stereotypical thoughts between themselves, showing the influence of music and stereotypical culture on themselves.These are my opinions, not what he intended we take from the video. I may have all or nothing wrong. Take from this what you will.",0

731,"If you don't like this video or black people, why even comment? Go watch another video that you'd enjoy. Why waste your time?_______________________The symbolisms that I noticed after watching the full video 3 times.1. SZA is the Statue of Liberty.  (Black women = the true liberty).2. The chorus of this song mocks  mumble rap, as mumble rappers are more concerned about their $$$ than liberty,  justice and their own people.3. The same gun that was used to shoot the innocent bystander, was given to the little black (also in the church scene).4. The gun that was used to shoot the bystander was handled with care, while the dead body was dragged.5. The kids in the video are dancing and throwing $$$. Which basically means that 'our' black kids are being distracted from social issues, due to rap culture. 6.When the church choir is singing, Childish was rapping about $$$. I'm not sure if that was intentional. I suppose the point of the church scene was to discuss gun violence in churches in America. 7. At the end everyone is running, at first it look like from white men and then from blacks (ourselves).8. There are kids sitting on the second floor with white bandanas tied around their mouth/necks, representing gang violence. They are also all on their cellular phones. 9. There's a white horse in the video. I wonder if that is a biblical reference. ""One interpretation held by evangelist Billy Graham, casts the rider of the white horseÊas the Antichrist, or a representation of false prophets, citing differences between theÊwhite horseÊin RevelationÊchapter 6 and Jesus on the white HorseÊinÊRevelationÊchapter 19.""The voice at the 3:04 mark sounds like Kanye West lol.",0

Sure one could interpret art plenty of way, but it wouldÕve been easy for Gambino to portray a white man shooting those people up, but thatÕs not what he did, making one wonder what his actual message heÕs trying to get across is.",0

975,"I'm not going to act like I'm some kind of intellectual, but what I'm taking away from this video is that Donald and his dancers plays the white man in this video, casually ""dancing"" into black people's lives and causing havoc. A black man gets shot by a white man, the black community riots, the police beats them to shit, and then it's quiet until the white man dances into the scene once again, seeing that things are a little peaceful and finding it boring, so he picks up an AK (or whatever auto that gun was) and causes some more havoc again, happily dancing about the chaos he causes for his own amusement. And in the end he dances as the stage is empty, supposedly because (almost) everyone is dead.What I don't get is the ending, though, because if my theory there is correct, then I don't understand why those people are running after him. Though you can only see their silhouettes, it does look like those are white people. In that case maybe this is more of a commentary on black-on-black violence and Donald just portrays a black man shooting his fellow black men, only giving the whites more reason to believe that blacks are violent? That would explain the whites running after him in the last part. But that wouldn't make sense because that church shooting was clearly a nod to the Charleston church shooting, which was perpetrated by a white man on a back community church. Unless that was unintentional, of course.Then again I could also be completely wrong, I'm no expert on this shit.Also, was that SZA by the car? Damn well looks like her.",0

1018,"ÒThis Is AmericaÓ graphically depicts gun violence, with some claiming the video, in certain scenes, is trying to convey how firearms are treated with more respect than human lives. In the opening scenes, Glover shoots an unnamed person, execution style. In the following frame, the gun is carried off in a special cloth by a well-dressed man while the lifeless body is dragged away. Each time someone is shot, this same process takes place.imilarly, the video points out the consistent presence of firearms when it comes to acts of terror. In addition to the aforementioned execution scene, the above shot, where members of a choir are singing, could be pointing to the 2015 Charleston Church Massacre. Here, the video potentially stresses that death by gun violence is not a one-off occurrence, more so when it comes to black Americans.Notably before their death, the choir repeatedly sings, ÒGrandma told me/Get your money black man,Ó which has been attributed to religionÕs encouragement of material obsession.",0

Jim Crow also wears yellow pants gray shoes, gambino wears those colors reversed. Then the way he dances and opens his eyes but can be a representation of Jim Crow minstrel shows, where white guys would wear black face to make fun of him and make fun of his intelligence and disabilities. The slaying of the choir can be interpreted as whatever you want but i think itÕs either how we kill innocent blacks take there music but then say there lifeÕs donÕt matter by this is America, or how Dylan roof shot up the black church, all relating back to black lives movement imo.

1115,"So I've noticed something about this video that no one has touched yet.  There are some interesting things about the second shooting in this video.  Now, just to be clear, I'm not a gun nut or anything, I do believe in the 2nd amendment but have never personally fired a gun of any kind in my life.  Most of my knowledge about guns I have gotten through debate with people I would describe as actual gun nuts. So with that in mind,  I'm unsure what kind of gun he is using in this video, but I do feel about 99.99% confident that this weapon is firing automatically, or he's got an amazingly fast trigger finger.  Automatic weapons are banned in the US for civilian use, they are only used by the military.  Not a single one of the recent mass shootings(and possibly none of them ever, I'm not sure) has been done by an automatic weapon.  AR's are actually not automatic weapons like a lot of people think, they are semi automatic.   The Las Vegas shooter was using a bump stock to simulate automatic fire, but this gun doesn't have a bump stock.The second thing I noticed was how many shots were fired.   I'm pretty sure I hear four distinct shots in there, but it's quick so I instead decided  to focus on the discarded shells, I slowed down the video to .25 speed and I count 4 shells flying through the air, so what I heard and see apparently match.   But there are 10 people in the choir and they appear to all drop dead, none of them look like they were ducking under their own control.   So four shots fired, but 10 people dead, that is one magic bull...err 4 magic bullets(JFK/Seinfeld reference there).Now people I've mentioned this to have told me I'm overthinking it, that this is just supposed to represent a shooting and the specifics going on don't really matter.  But here's the problem I have with that, every other aspect of this video has such an amazing attention to detail, with so many hidden meanings that are still being uncovered.   So in order to believe this I would have to accept that this part of the video had an amazingly poor attention to detail and facts(like an automatic weapon being used to symbolize one of the shootings in our country where an automatic weapon was never used).  This could certainly be the case, even very detail oriented people can make mistakes.  But I lean more toward the belief that this was intentional and has some hidden meaning.   What that is, I still haven't decided yet, but I'd like to hear what people think about it.",0

I'm not saying the video is bad (far from it); I'm just tired of social commentaries that just tell you the bad things, without saying what we can do to change things. Most commentaries like this enjoy pointing out the problems in something flawed but great yet giving little to no solution.For example, Childish shows so many problems in America as well as satirizing pop culture but his solutions to the dilemmas are delivered said small and rapidly that you almost miss them. Yes, he says, ""Don't catch you slippin now,"" but compare that to all the dilemmas he brings up and how fast he says it.

1453,"The beginning of the video is a reflection of a Jim Crowe character. Hence the dance, the face he made and the stance he took before shooting that man. It's a reflection of how America sees blacks. America just sees violent fools. This video and the song itself have such a deep and tremendous message, but you as an American just let it fly over your head. America is doomed along with the rest of this world.",0

1459,"IÕve watched the video a few times since yesterday and I think I understand what itÕs about. This is literally what I think based on observation so pls donÕt come attacking me if it means something entirely different. Thanks.Sooo at the start of the video, a man comes in and starts playing his guitar. You can clearly see his face and how happy he is to be playing his guitar. This would probs represent every black life in America; showing that we ARE people with identities and can be very Ôfull of lifeÕ type of people. The camera then pans over to Childish Gambino/Donald Glover who is dancing and moving closer and closer to the man playing his guitar. The camera then moves out and the man has his face covered. Gambino then shoots him in the back of the head and someone comes to wrap his gun in a cloth. This symbolises black lives that are lost and are tried to be covered up from society and that the shooter is Ônever foundÕ. Moving on to the middle of the video, Gambino is always dancing and weÕre all wondering why if heÕs singing about America and how we shouldnÕt be caught sleeping on it. His dancing is used as a distraction from whatÕs going on in the background. In the background, there are protests, riots and other crimes going on that represent the part of America that is often hidden. Also, the members of the church choir who are singing before they get shot, I imagine they are representing the black lives lost back in 2012 (pls correct me if IÕm wrong) in the church in Texas. Also there are people sat at the top of a building recording everything thatÕs going on around them rather than actually doing something which shows the tragic truth that instead of people to do something about violence going on, they would rather upload it to social media and seem like they care by using ÔsupportiveÕ hashtags. Constantly throughout the video, Gambino uses new and popular American dances to distract viewers from the reality that is America. Now, this isnÕt a bad thing, but he is cleverly showing people that this is what everyone seems to be doing when real life things like these happen. Honestly, Donald Glover is the only Donald I know trying to make America great again but of course, thatÕs just my opinion. This video was greatly demonstrated and IÕm glad it is getting the attention it deserves. Again, donÕt attack me if I got anything wrong, rather call me up on it. This is literally just. my. opinion. and. findings.",0

1498,"1. He is dressed this way in order to recreate a modern day slave.2. He is dancing this way in order to distract you from the violence and chaos in the background which relates to social media and how it distracts people from real world problems.3. The church scene is a reference the Charleston Church Shooting.4. The lyric Òthis a celly, thatÕs a toolÓ is a reference to murder of Stephon Clark. He was killed because the cop Òthought he had a weaponÓ which later was recognized as a phone.5. After he shoots someone, the gun is taken into a cloth and carried away. This shows how guns are treated with more care than African American lives.6. The style of the song is like modern day rap music. A lot of adlibs and repetitiveness, a lot of people think he is mocking the music.7. In the end, he is seen running with an expression of fear on his face with a crowd of people behind him. This could be a reference to him running  away from the baggage and problems in America. 8. Overall, this video was about how it is to be a black male living in America.I tried to put everything in order so that it would go along with the video. I hope this helped people understand the video more it was a lot to interpret.",0

Again look at 1:56. They take the gun away in a cloth. After that it shows two people running toward the deceased with weapons. Again, they took more care of the weapon than the deceased. Supposed to symbolize how we care for more our machines, not individual people.Also look at 2:38 there's the horse. Directly before that there's a group of teens on their phones. Supposed to symbolize how we are so distracted with media that we're blinded by what's really going on around us.If we didn't analyze this in class I probably would've missed a lot of this stuff lol. It's really an interesting music video and there's a lot behind it.",0
1536,"The meanings behind this MV are very chilling...I was always aware of racism and all the problems related to it and iÕve always had hatred towards it, but this one got me thinking a lot last night.IÕll never understand why this continues to happen or the mindset of the people doing it...why do some people only choose to focus on a single difference of another person ( skin colour for instance ) but ignore all the similarities that they share.Slavery was such a cancerous trend, what were people thinking while applying it on others. IÕm happy that era ended but saddened that some people still think it was the right thing and are now trying to apply it along with some excuses to harm others that are slightly different than them.IÕm sorry that some people have to suffer through racism again despite it being the 21st century. It seems like weÕre going back in time lately to that horrible era.",0
1537,Videos supposed to show how Americans especially white people love black culture but donÕt care about black people they also value their rights to guns over life and safety hence him placing the weapons on cloths when heÕs done with them the dancing and in your faces stuff is to distract you from the things happening in the background which is what the mainstream media does to keep us distracted from the plot of the new world order,0
1538,"I personally think that the message is this song is how fast America gets over crime, as in when gambino shoots someone in the video the music goes all dull and dark but a few seconds later the happier music starts. There are so many death messages in the video E.G the horse and the 17 seconds of silence for the Florida shooting. Also I think the 2 chickens means how America was divided ( 1 chicken is coloured and one is white ) there is also a lot of old dance moves that represented slavery.            EDIT: also the dancing is to distract you from the violence in the background. Just like how the media can distract you from the truth",0

2059,"This video isn't just about the American Issue of violence/police violence which has become part of daily lives and societal norms. It's about the ability of society to experiment on it's people with systematic distortions of reality (intrapersonal to societal) to impacting ones experience of events and feelings. A hierarchical society forms developing communities and populations conditioned to feel self hatred and be distracted. Otherwise, Black People wouldn't be the utter representation of themselves (the image presented by society; a coon)in this video depicting a Jim Crow era (within a snapshot of the present day) black man dancing and entertaining us (ALL People) while there is a war going on around him. He is the character of the moment so caught up in his ego that he fails to notice the bloodshed and chaos Black People are experiencing. But this what America has been doing for a looonnng time. Since it's founding, right? Wait... have we forgotten already about all the Black Lives snuffed out and with us watching while it happened? While he is caught up in his performance kids are there to hype him up and follow his every move. They are rehearsing for their ""performance"" which will come sooner than expected because Black kids are ""old souls"" and often mature faster than other kids. Never given a chance to understand or form their own opinion but instead they are fed a constant stream of propaganda that parents must combat. But how do you keep up with the finest machine when you have to support a family and stay sane? Come on folks. We have to come out of the stupor we have been in for so long. The discussion on these threads should be how do we heal and examine ourselves in order to tackle this society.",0

2208,"The first time i watched this i was very confused and scared and thought the dancing was very distracting.. but thatÕs exactly it. The dancing was supposed to distract us. Him dancing symbolizes how us americans dance around the issue of gun violence. We are distracted by what the media puts out, so we just move around the issue instead of dealing with it. And, you know how he shot someone and just moved on and started dancing again like nothing happened? That shows how us americans have grown so used to shootings that when one happens, it seems near normal to us and we just move on to the next one. And the next one. And the next one. They are dancing to distract you from all the chaos that is going on in the background, like the media does with the real world.This is such a powerful and realistic video once you grasp the meaning.",0

SinceÊthe Enlightenment, ideologies such asÊnationalism,Êliberalism,Êsocialism, andÊreligious fundamentalismÊhave played an important role in shaping insurgencies and guerrilla warfare.Ê[15]One of the most remarkable guerrilla warfare warriors wasÊViriatus, aÊLusitanianÊwho led the resistance against theÊRoman EmpireÊby obtaining several victories between 147 BC and 139 BC in the region ofÊZamora, Spain.

2674,"I watched this video a couple times. The only things I was able to come up with was, at the beginning  the guy playing the guitar happily the camera pans away and comes to him after gambino walks up  and shoots him. What I think that could symbolize is black culture being shoot down. What I feel further backs this up is when the camera comes back to the man who was playing the guitar, you still hear the guitar but he isnÕt holding it and had a white over his head. Blacks did find blues and it was taken away from us by whites. Also we were killed for playing musical instruments during slavery.Before I get deeper into what I find I want to say all of this isnÕt gonna be a black vs white thing. I notice a lot of people complain about that now and days. So see this as a disclaimer.After gambino shoots the guy he says ÒThis is AmericaÓ almost like saying Òthis is what America has done to just a piece of a cultureÓ The dancing was a distraction, the shooting of the church choir could of easily represented the shooting that occurred at the South Carolina church.Idk I gotta watch more of the video AGAIN.BUT AT THE END. What really caught be about the end (Gambino running away from the crowd of people) is the fact that throughout the video he constantly says ÒTHIS IS AMERICA. Ò  but notice how America (Gambino) is running from the crowd, almost like heÕs saying ÒAmerica is running away a from the REAL problems. Whether it be racism, mass shootings , police brutality,  etc. ThatÕs all I could pull from this video SO FAR. Ima watch it back a couple times and see what else I can Peep.Please donÕt be judgmental IÕm just stating what I FEEL the video may be portraying",0

2687,"I feel like he has the school kids dancing around him to emphasize that the kids are our future and despite the pain and violence that happens around them, theyÕll always find a way to dance and persist. Then with the shooting of the choir and the guitar player itÕs like the notion of Òblack on black crimeÓ when a black person does it ppl just turn the other cheek and try to cover it up as soon as they can. Because itÕs turned into something that isnÕt as addressed anymore. And the choir was related to the church shooting that happened. And they were singing Òyou gon tell somebodyÓ and he shot them all and just said Òthis is AmericaÓ as if to let them know that their cries for help are insignificant. And at the end he was dancing on top of a car. His car was red I feel like that represented the blood that was spilled by blacks but the rest of the cars were blue and white. It was a poor representation of the American flag at the end. But what I donÕt understand is who heÕs running from at the end. Is it police? Random people? Someone help me understand.",0

When he's dancing on the car, in the very last shot, just before the screen sinks down to the bottom, there is a man in a hat and holding what looks like a book, of some sort, standing in the shadows. He's on the right side of the screen, behind a pillar, and you can literally only see him for a fraction of a second.

2769,I just watched this for the second time and right at what people are calling the moment of silence he looks like he is pulling a gun out and you can hear the people he was dancing with running  away and screaming like he is going to shoot them. I'm sorry but this is not art. I really like some of the dancing and beat of the song but I believe this video promotes violence. He coldly shoots people all of a sudden. This is mocking shootings not giving tribute. Music videos used to be good decades ago. Not anymore. These young directors need to find another job since they cannot make art.,0

The world is messed up but lets be real... most (almost all) people watching this saying how profound this video is will do nothing to change the world around them. They will, of course, complain about things when they benefit them. They will never actively look inside themselves or their communities and try to change things for the better.

2890,"The point of the song is that while America has a gun issue (this includes everything from police brutality to gang violence) we are way more focused on pop culture (him and the students dancing with the riots in the background, the fact that nobody realized one of the horsemen of the apocalypse in the background, all of the people on their cell phones when people are dying around them).Also, that's not Trayvon Martin's father playing the guitar, its Calvin IIEdit: Some things to clear up really quick...-This is my interpretation, I could be wrong-While the US is only 37th in the world for gun violence that's comparing it to 3rd world countries such as Venezuela and Guatemala. The US has 8 times as many gun deaths per 100,000 citizens compared to Canada-This could also be about black on black violence, I never said that it couldn't be (I honestly don't know if that's the focus)\-The part where he shoots the parish members is a clear reference to the Charleston church massacre.-I'm pro 2nd amendment and I'm well aware that America has plenty of other issues (such as the war on drugs and mental health). But it's not like America can't have multiple issues at once, is it really that hard to see that we have both a mental health issue AND a gun issue?",0

The cop car shows that the government is corrupt because the cops joined the chaos. The return of the guitarist shows that even thru the darkness and corruption and chaos, light will always prevail. And at the end when he was running it predicts how we will see our mistakes when its too late and try to run from them rather than face them like the screwed up society we are.",0

The violence and police chasing happening in the background shows the violence that america ignores everyday against black people. However this isn't a one directional message against white Americans, it also shows how black people promote a life style of ignorance in there music. But in reference to the facial expressions gambino makes- he is demonstrating how white people depicted blacks during slavery/segregation. Black people were dealt a bad hand from Americas start - at segregation's end they were respected by whites only as entertainers and given no value as humans outside of that. Sadly black culture in america supports this life style of a flashy materialistic life style of greed, which leads to violence against there own kind, and unfair over all stigmas that give rise to police brutality....

3469,"The most interesting thing to me is the character that Glover is portraying.  He has a certain disconnected, emotionless feel to him that becomes fun and then hateful, turning on a dime. I can't quite put my finger on it, but the first time I saw it I knew it was perfect.  His actions are vicious but completely disconnected from their consequences.  It's a great portrayal of the violence in America.  After you shoot up a church or school, you shouldn't just show up the next time looking like ""its just another day ... ho hum"". You should be screaming in agony at what you just did ... it's insane to react any other way.",0
3470,"Some of this is facts but not all of it I agree with. The left says get rid of guns and violence will go away. The right says the guns aren't the problem because it takes a human being to pull the trigger. I personally lean to the right on guns because a gun can't fire itself. It takes a human being with a thought to pick up the tool and charge the bolt back, take it off safe, and squeeze the trigger. The problem is the people! We literally have a culture of music that talks about nothing nowadays but selling drugs and killing people and someone could seriously think the problem is the gun? Not at all. The problem is people are going to do something bad and if you take away the tools you aren't going to get rid of them because they can still have other ways of accessing them. If you watch anything that documents drugs all of these people carry guns for the just in case. Most of these people have felonies on their records meaning they CAN NOT LEGALLY PURCHASE A FIREARM meaning they OBTAINED it somewhere else. Open your eyes and stop living in an ignorant society. Be a leader and quit being a sheep amongst wolves. Or at least educate yourself and learn to be a critical thinker. Has anyone else not thought for a second that maybe if we educate people better and knock the ignorance out of their heads maybe we wouldn't have a society that acts like animals? You can tell someone that heroin is bad all day long and tell them not to do it but when they do it you blame the drug and not the person. That's stupid. Grown men and women need to act as such and I do not feel sorry for people who make bad decisions.",0

3495,"Woa. He shot the black guy who was chained for playing traditional music. Then a riot broke out while school children are dancing. Next, ni$$as started acting out ""on their worst behavior"" all over a material lifestyle. Afterwards, he uzi-ed church people singing in praises to the all mighty dollar. This created another riot that school children had to dance through. yet again. The school children are buying into the images of America they see and start looking hood. A black man briefly rode through on a white horse - but nothing really changed. Drugs are introduced as a way to numb our reaction to the results of that black man's efforts. The black guys learns that he can play his music as long as its done under the guise of anonymity. It will be appreciated because millennials are obsessed with nostalgic obscurity anyway...

3496,"My interpretation is:Childish Gambino is the ""figurative America"" in this video. He's in disguise (as a black man around a lot of other blacks) although he's doing all the distracting of the chaos and commiting crimes murdering  and getting away with it hence the repetitive..singing ""they won't catch ya"" aka America cold handedly (when the guy takes the evidence, the gun  into a cloth for him) once the prophecy of ""Death riding on a white horse"" is full filled (if you notice the man is WHITE who is in ALL BLACK attire riding on the white horse; LOOK AT HIS HAND) after he leaves the scene on the horse everything is quiet and desolate which is why there are empty cars some if not all of which appear recently & randomly vacant as if a catastrophy took place like in the ""Apocalyptic movies""  He stands triumphantly in the middle of it All with no real witnesses (no more than one) Sza idk why she is sitting pretty but the guy who IS/WAS First to GO didn't see what hit him and he sits at the end with a bag over his face like a victim when A Preditor tactic is to make it so you don't know where you are or how you got there when he kidnaps you!!

He has rapper like Blocboy, 21 Savage, and Young Thug to ad-lib for him so we can see example of how black men who made it to a high status in life have to think and act to get to where they are now. These rapper (at least they claim they did)had to sell drugs, shoot people, and etcs just to feed their families.

3581,"Basically, from watching the video and reading these comments, i'm able to gather this being the message: This is America, don't get caught slippin, We live ""in the land of the free and home of the brave"" nd the confidence instilled in us through this ""free"" life, we ignore the mass shooting, the racial issues, and just important pressing matters, and we focus on media, dancing, drugs(while i dont think mentioned in the song) but so on and so forth, we got the trade war with china, all the stupid shit said and done by trump, but instead of scrutinizing him, we focus on Kanye, lmao, and essentially, towards the end, you see a horse, and a guy or girl idk in a reaper costume, all black, on a white horse( refer to revelations in the bible he's spoken of, leaving a trail of destruction and pestilence(disease). nd yeah, theres still more to be seen and more in depth, but that's the jist of the video aand it's message.

UNTIL in the END it comes for YOU in your face.. and even then you run and can't stand on your square. The End. (You run your whole life blindly.) Facts. This is America! People will perish for lack of knowledge but then there's the excuse of the idiots to say ""but you will perish anyway so who cares."" Stay away from them. Knowledge is power. Obtain it and use it.

3658,"So my analyses is that CG character is an artist who is aiming to excel in hip hop. He kills the unknown black artist to symbolises the death of artist having a connection to their music? Then he reminds himself that he's in America so he and the audience can't slip up. He creates a trend or more likely hops on one with the kids while he ignores the growing drama around them. constantly reminding himself not to slip up or heÕll lose all the riches this form of entertainment brings. Then the church scene happens...Which I think could be a metaphor? I mean, it brings to mind the Charleston shooting but the song they sing about a grandma encouraging a black man to get their money, it fits really well with the idea that he's an artist trying to cope with being a fun outlandish rapper while the world going to ish...Oh yeah! The end scene gives me the feel that CG wasn't ready for the swarm that is mass media consumption, ran largely by white people.__",0

That's why I think we see not only see white people pursuing but one black girl on the left because the media influences us to turn against our own kind... tmz editing the interview to have a backlash on Kanye.",0

I must have watched this 10 times now and I keep noticing new things and thinking about what they could mean.The first time I watched I was too busy saying ""omg he just shot that man!"" to even notice the detail of the gun being taken gently and wrapped in what appears to be silk. Small details like that speak volumes. Biblical and apocalyptic imagery abound! Was the dude on the white horse representative of the grim reaper? I also recently noticed that the cars toward the end all have their hazard lights on. I wonder what exactly that's supposed to mean. I also wonder why the children he dances with are wearing school uniforms? Is it just to make it clear that these are children, in case their younger  appearance and smaller size weren't indication enough? Or is there a deeper meaning to that?",0

There could also be a reason why it happens when he shows a miming of violence but without a gun in the picture like saying how once the topic gets away from guns themselves no one wants to address the problem of police brutality and violence anymore.

4202,Basically what I'm getting from this is betrayal of the black community going through times of struggle there's nothing that has been hidden everything that he has done in this video everyone should have heard of especially the children dancing they just dance they don't care about anything that goes around them which kind of also messes with the education system since they're not paying attention and only focusing on dancing and mainstream things as you can tell with the dances and you can also tell by the kids wearing the mask in the video up top if you look carefully which is a type of trend which has been happening,0

A igreja  uma das mais antigas igrejas de afro-americanos no pas e tem sido um local para a organizao comunitria em torno dos direitos civis. 9 pessoas foram MORTAS.Nas duas vezes que o Gambino atira nas pessoas, aparece um rapaz que recolhe a arma com bastante cuidado, segundo algumas interpretaes, essa pessoa simboliza a america que se preocupa mais com as armas do que com as pessoas!!Gambino tambm copiou passos de dana de trappers (Block boy JB que fez uma msica com o Drake) e at o flow do Lil pump em gucci gang. Isso  uma real critica com as ""besteiras"" que a sociedade se envolve e se importa enquanto o caos acontece.Cs perceberam que o caos do clipe inteirin param quando ele ascende um baseado? E que ele vai para um lugar alto e parece feliz? o beck  meio que a representao de um refgio, mas depois voc volta ao caos (final do clipe)No sei se vocs viram mas tem uma parte do clipe que no fundo tem uma pessoa montada em cavalo branco e uma viatura logo atrs, isso tudo se refere ao capitulo 6 de apocalipse versculo 8 que diz: ""E eu olhei, e eis um cavalo plido: e seu nome que se sentou sobre ele era a morte, e o inferno seguiu com ele"". Os estudantes que aparecem no clipe danando com Gambino faz meno ao massacre de estudantes em Soweto, Africa do Sul. O uniforme que esto usando  o mesmo!Em meio ao todo aquele caos vemos pessoas megas tranquilas no alto de uma escada que parecem no se importar com nada do que est acontecendo e que s filmam tudo com os seus celulares: Nossa atual realidade!",0

4490,"Maybe its a commentary on how the perception of black culture in the U.S. has changed from what it was to what pop culture says it is now. Shooting the guitarist and later the choir singers could symbolise how black culture is being killed off by this idea that a black man should be a hardcore gangster whose only concern should be making money in any way possible and that this idea has become so persuasive to people that they believe it's true so when he raises his hand while pretending to hold a gun everyone scatters because he's black and they expect him to be violent. Dragging the dead guitarist off while taking the gun on a towel could be showing how its being hidden and ignored in favour of this pop culture ideal of a gangster rapper being what young black men should aspire to be. Same with the choir singers with the difference that now you have people attacking any symbol of black culture, good or bad, because they expect what they're seeing in modern pop culture to be the norm, which because it's now at the forefront of everything you're getting more of so you end up with a cycle of each new generation growing up to believe that black men should be money oriented and violent.",1

I guess that is the world we live in. To sit down and watch this video and understand within a minute what Donald is getting at in the country he lives in is just a statement.

4876,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand This is America. The message is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of modern day society most of the ideas will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also GambinoÕs nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these ideas, to realise that they're not just thoughts- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike This is America truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the message in Gambino's existential catchphrase ""This is America,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Hiro Murai's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. __And yes, by the way, i DO have a This is America tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

I didn't see that coming because the SNL performance was obviously without all the graphic visuals, but see the the impact of what he's expressing.  he seems to be showing in his artistic way how our world has accepted guns and shooting as commonplace, people so consumed with selfies, videotaping an event so it goes viral which then brings a person views and popularity - or money!, the ""me, me, me"" mentality while becoming more numb to the harshest violence taking place around us, by the day. America is allowing it to happen and wants to divide and conquer the people here by incriminating african americans and others as well as planning these shootings (do people really think all these shootings are just happening because it's trendy?!) think again. our government want chaos to distract you from what is happening. it's a frightening thought to know this is a reality.  and, he's brave enough to call it out in his music.",0

5088,"This is America. Blacks committed 52 percent of homicides between 1980 and 2008, despite composing just 13 percent of the population. Across the same timeframe, whites committed 45 percent of homicides while composing 77% of the population, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.Here are some more statistics from the FBI:In 2013, the FBI has black criminals carrying out 38 per cent of murders, compared to 31.1 per cent for whites. The offenderÕs race was ÒunknownÓ in 29.1 per cent of cases.What about violent crime more generally? FBI arrest rates are one way into this. Over the last three years of data Ð 2011 to 2013 Ð 38.5 per cent of people arrested for murder, manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault were black.This is America. Blacks are 10 percent of the population in Los Angeles, CA, but commit 42 percent of its robberies and 34 percent of its felonies. Whites make up 29 percent of the city's population, and commit 5 percent of its robberies and 13 percent of its felonies.In New York City, blacks committed ""75 percent of all shootings, 70 percent of all robberies, and 66 percent of all violent crime,"" despite only composing 23 percent of the population, said Mac Donald in a Hillsdale speech. Additionally, 2009 Bureau of Justice Statistics numbers show that in 2009, ""blacks were charged with 62 percent of robberies, 57 percent of murders and 45 percent of assaults in the 75 biggest counties in the country, despite only comprising roughly 15 percent of the population in these counties.""This is America. Even allowing for the existence of discrimination in the criminal justice system, the higher rates of crime among black Americans cannot be denied,Ó wrote James Q. Wilson and Richard Herrnstein in their classic 1985 study, ÒCrime and Human Nature.Ó ÒEvery study of crime using official data shows blacks to be overrepresented among persons arrested, convicted, and imprisoned for street crimes.Ó This was true decades before the authors put it to paper, and it remains the case decades later.ÒThe overrepresentation of blacks among arrested persons persists throughout the criminal justice system,Ó wrote Wilson and Herrnstein. ÒThough prosecutors and judges may well make discriminatory judgments, such decisions do not account for more than a small fraction of the overrepresentation of blacks in prison.ÓThis is America. This data disproves the notion that racism is what drives higher rates of arrests among the blacks than among whites or broader America.6. According to Riley, ""Black crime rates were lower in the 1940s and 1950s, when black poverty was higher"" and ""racial discrimination was rampant and legal.""If it's not racism and poverty that are blame for the high black crime rate, then what is?This is America. Cops killed nearly twice as many whites as blacks in 2015. According to data compiled by The Washington Post, 50 percent of the victims of fatal police shootings were white, while 26 percent were black. The majority of these victims had a gun or ""were armed or otherwise threatening the officer with potentially lethal force,"" according to Mac Donald in a speech at Hillsdale College.This is America. Some may argue that these statistics are evidence of racist treatment toward blacks, since whites consist of 62 percent of the population and blacks make up 13 percent of the population. But as Mac Donald writes in The Wall Street Journal, 2009 statistics from the Bureau of Justice Statistics reveal that blacks were charged with 62 percent of robberies, 57 percent of murders and 45 percent of assaults in the 75 biggest counties in the country, despite only comprising roughly 15 percent of the population in these counties.""Such a concentration of criminal violence in minority communities means that officers will be disproportionately confronting armed and often resisting suspects in those communities, raising officersÕ own risk of using lethal force,"" writes MacDonald.This is America. According to Mac Donald, 12 percent of white and Hispanic homicide deaths were due to police officers, while only four percent of black homicide deaths were the result of police officers.""If weÕre going to have a 'Lives Matter' anti-police movement, it would be more appropriately named ""White and Hispanic Lives Matter,'"" said Mac Donald in her Hillsdale speech.3. The Post's data does show that unarmed black men are more likely to die by the gun of a cop than an unarmed white man...but this does not tell the whole story. In August 2015, the ratio was seven-to-one of unarmed black men dying from police gunshots compared to unarmed white men; the ratio was six-to-one by the end of 2015. But Mac Donald points out in The Marshall Project that looking at the details of the actual incidents that occurred paints a different picture:The ÒunarmedÓ label is literally accurate, but it frequently fails to convey highly-charged policing situations. In a number of cases, if the victim ended up being unarmed, it was certainly not for lack of trying. At least five black victims had reportedly tried to grab the officerÕs gun, or had been beating the cop with his own equipment. Some were shot from an accidental discharge triggered by their own assault on the officer. And two individuals included in the PostÕs Òunarmed black victimsÓ category were struck by stray bullets aimed at someone else in justified cop shootings. If the victims were not the intended targets, then racism could have played no role in their deaths.In one of those unintended cases, an undercover cop from the New York Police Department was conducting a gun sting in Mount Vernon, just north of New York City. One of the gun traffickers jumped into the copÕs car, stuck a pistol to his head, grabbed $2,400 and fled. The officer gave chase and opened fire after the thief again pointed his gun at him. Two of the officerÕs bullets accidentally hit a 61-year-old bystander, killing him. That older man happened to be black, but his race had nothing to do with his tragic death. In the other collateral damage case, Virginia Beach, Virginia, officers approached a car parked at a convenience store that had a homicide suspect in the passenger seat. The suspect opened fire, sending a bullet through an officerÕs shirt. The cops returned fire, killing their assailant as well as a woman in the driverÕs seat. That woman entered the PostÕs database without qualification as an Òunarmed black victimÓ of police fire.",0

They can't be caught slipping and they have to make money, the way our society expects them to, i.e. dancing/rapping. If they are, then they get chased out. I think furthermore, this video is trying to highlight how we're all being forced to follow our stereotypes. A justification for this opinion is the fact that all the people outside of Donald Glover, are wearing some sort of uniform, minus random extras. I think Donald Glover isn't the type of person to focus on issues that effect just one group of people.",0

5203,"So, what i get from this video goes like this: The young artist comes up during a time where the old, inspired and folkloric music is around (in this context its african). He gets the spotlight and he likes how everyone is looking at him, so he shoots the guitar guy to keep the spotlight. The younger generation geoove with him and enjoy his music, making him take inspiration from stuff they do to keep said spotlight. Further down, the spolight goes back to the soul singing choir, but the artist comes back and shoots the choir only to get the spotlight back. There, chaos echoes in the background, people run left and right, but the artist keeps the spotlight and keeps his music going, making the younger people be obnoxious to what happens behind them too. IDK if anyone noticrd as well, but in the background, we hear chaotic noise, which stops only once Gambino starts rapping about how much money he got and how much hes better than you. At the end of the video, the artist starts thinking aboit what hes done and regrets his acts, shown by him making the gun motion, but not actually having one and being rather disappointed. At the end, the artist embraces his roots, echoed by the mixing of the rap beat and the soul singing, and hes seen being truly happy, for it is whaf he is, but nobody pays attention to him, there is no one who grpoves with him, listens to him or is even near him (except for a fellow artist). I think the ending of the video shows everyone trying to chase him down for doing what he loves, so he retires from their presence, fearing for his life.Pretty long, but thats my first take opinion of this video and song. There are more things to go on deeply about, but this post is already pretty long, so imma just stop here.",0

5393,"ÔThis is AmericaÕ is a piece of music written by Childish Gambino and has been converted into a music video that provides visual support to the lyrics of the song. Throughout the music video, themes of standard American controversies such as gun safety, shootings and the oppression of black people is evident, through the use of graphic imagery, symbolism of characters, contrast between peopleÕs actions, and the portrayal of Childish Gambino himself.Symbolism of racial segregation is seen in the opening scene of the music video when Childish Gambino begins to dance before shooting a man (0:25). These dance moves are similar to those of a character from a popular song ÔJump Jim CrowÕ which is pejorative towards the racial segregation in the United States. This character was the inspiration for the name of Jim Crow laws that were enforced from the late 19th century until 1965. These laws were Òupheld by the United States Supreme Court's ""separate but equal"" doctrine for African AmericansÓ (Jim Crow), consenting of the segregation between African Americans and white americans on public facilities such as transport and schools. By touching upon this character, Childish Gambino was able to make a reference to the United StateÕs past history of racial segregation and remind the audience the impact of this problem. Highlighting its lingering presence in modern society.Contrasts between the treatment of materialistic objects and people in the following scene can be seen to highlight peopleÕs opinion on issues revolving shootings (0:54). After Childish Gambino shots an inoccent black man in the head, he hands the gun to a man who bows down and places the gun on a red handkerchief. This ÔcareÕ of the gun contrasts with how the victim is dealt after the shooting, as he is dragged away forcefully. This shows the contrast in difference in care that people give towards the gun, and of the victim in a situation like this, where the gun is of higher grounds than the victim himself. This also shows that despite obviously noticing the victim was hurt by the gun, it object is still treated as a prized possession.Irony is used to bring out the issue of gun safety and its impacts on people. At time 1:41-1:58 in the music video, the camera pans to display 10 African Americans singing church songs in religious outfits, where immediately after, Childish Gambino opens fire and shoots all of them. This is a reference to the Charleston church shooting on June 17th, 2015, when a white supremacist shot up 9 African Americans during a prayer service. The irony of ÒOne of the United StateÕs oldest black churches, which has long been a site for community organization around civil rights.Ó (Charleston Church Shooting), a supposedly peaceful environment turned violent highlights the drastic problem of gun safety and itÕs harms towards people. By touching upon the shooting, Childish Gambino brings out the issue of innocent black deaths in the hands of white supremacists. Contrasts between the seriousness the situation with the playfulness of how parties view it is used to highlight the impacts the situation has of the people. Immediately after shooting a man, or after shooting a church service, Childish Gambino immediately begins dancing. This act can be interpreted in two ways. The first is how quickly America rolls over the issues and continues with their lives and uses distractions to ignore the real issues. The second, is that this is perhaps a ways oppressed people overcome such issues brought onto them and try to forget about the situation entirely. The focuses of each shot in each scene further emphasises where the American priorities lie. In the scenes after each shooting, the camera immediately focuses on the dance Childish Gambino does. Childish Gambino and his dancers are placed in the focus of the shots, and the chaos and riots at the back are unfocused and act as background images. This again emphasizes on what America turned their attention to when situations are bleak; instead of focusing on the issue itself, they find ways to escape the problem and divert their attention. The choice of characters in the music video emphasize the normality of the problem and what people do in these situations. There are a total of 2 shootings in the video: the first of a man playing the guitar, the second of a church service. The victims of these shootings were all noticeably innocent. Furthermore, the actions they performed are everyday practises, and by shooting normal citizens up, it shows that anyone can be affected by the problem. The dancers Childish Gambino dances with, are visibly all school students in their school uniform. This is a reference to the past US school shootings that have hurt innocent students. Finally, footage of bystanders can be seen after the church shooting, and this shows how Americans react to incidents like this. Instead of actively helping out, they stand by the side lines. Works Cited""Charleston Church Shooting."" Wikipedia, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston_church_shooting.

5422,"After reading some of the comments, I've seen people say ""no, this is Black America,"" sure, you are entitled to your opinion; but I think what Donald was trying to get through in this video is that in America, there is a lot of unnecessary violence and issues going on, and the people that are on their phones (just before you see the shoot dance) shows how those who are in higher social/economic classes choose to ignore it because they have the power in themselves to be able to let the issues of America go over their head. You shouldn't look at the fact that almost(if not) everyone is black and think that this is another ""Black Lives Matter"" or ""Blacks are oppressed"" sort of movement; because even though just about everyone in the video is black, Donald was trying to portray each small part of the video as a social class (which include any and all kinds of races).",0

So the youth are going to cope by partying to feel good and push the pain away because the elders are too busy or unconcerned to provide support through the trauma. In that process, young people are becoming more desensitized as the tragedies occur. There will always be one kid who will look up to Childish Gambino's character and follow his foot steps as he is the only adult present hence, the kids surrounding CG and handling his weapons.",0

I honestly cannot pay attention to the shit that is going on the background.... I watched this like 10 times and all I want to do is watch him! he is absolutely hypnotizing!  his moves, his constantly changing expressions... and those long one shot takes.... incredible!!! absolutely obsessed with this audio and visual art work... I'm not even going to touch on the meaning...you can write endless essays on that!  every scene feels absolutely drenched in symbolism... that's why its genius and real art.. it makes your brain work, makes you feel all sorts of emotions and is just so beautiful to watch. Even the fucked up parts... like a car crash you cant look away from and in reality... neither should you! gotta look at the reality of things! anyways, like o said.. don't want to write a whole essay.. just came here to express utter admiration for this modern master piece!!! what an incredible man!",1

So the slave could not have a gun because then he could tell the slave owner to go fuck himself...yes? But that wasnÕt the case, was it. Fast forward 400 something years. Equate this now with government and citizen in mind as slave owner to slave. Ready.....which political platform today does not want the citizen to have guns? Yes you guessed it the Democrats. Now ask yourself why is this? Then ask yourself how in the fuck are they going to protect said citizen? Wait for it....wait for it....keep waiting. Im sure someone will call 911 eventually. Malcolm X once said: The one main difference between the white liberal and the white conservative is the white liberal is much more deceitful. The greatest trick the devil ever did was convince the world he did not exist. Now he is right there in front of your eyes for you all to see but instead you brain dead wanna be political genius see nothing and know nothing. Just what the devil and the left want. #stupidfuckingzombies",1

6237,"One thing that I was thinking about after watching the video is the showing of black people throughout America. As a race, African Americans have been used as a whole has been forms of entertainment. In the early 1900's, they used the blackface to make fun of a race. Then, after WW1, we had the Civil Rights Movement to protest about the treatment of black people in America, but with groups like the Jackson 5 & The Temptations, To actors like Harry Belafonte and Sidney Portier, people used their entertainment to censor the true problems. Then disco and rap became popular and blinded people of the drug and gang problems. Then with the 90's rolling in, Dance crazes started to become the norm for conformity in America. And now here we are, in the 2000's, it currently being 2018, where everybody has lost their minds. Dancing and music, as well as actors and athletes are all black people are good for and if they don't fit in to one of those categories, you're a criminal. If you don't believe me, just look up black teens compared to white teens. Kanye West supports Donald Trump's and said that slavery was a choice and Donald Trump's has his own stuff that he needs to worry about(paying off Stormi Daniels). But I think that the ending scene was more than just the sunken place. I think that it is a visual representation of how black people feel when they want to do something with their lives and when they do well is when everybody else is chasing them to bring them down while they're just trying to survive.",0

6286,"I agree with many of what others have seen and interpreted; I saw a few things that meant something to me too. 1. It looks like he (and everyone else) is in a FEMA internment facility.  2. The people with the Cell phones are absolutely using them as ""tools"", but in many different ways.  They are wearing masks, which would imply anonymity, but since they too are also in the facility, their anonymity is a rouse.  Cell phones have certainly been a tool to document, and thank God for that in many ways, but obviously phones are perhaps the most effective tools to distract and numb us to the world around us, and also to isolate us from each other, decrease our ability to communicate and interact on a personal level.  3. Gun violence: one thing can represent many things... There's sort of a ""what would Jim Crow do, if he had a gun"" vibe to the first two killings; or maybe it's to do with how gun violence takes away from the beauty of our cultural influences on society; and considering he's a black man killing black people, it takes a step deeper on how black-on-black violence takes has an even stronger impact on that.  4. Glover is either dancing, or shooting someone in this video.  If he's not entertaining us, he's terrorizing us.  Could possibly reflect how he feels Black people are viewed in America.  5. And when he takes 17 seconds to smoke, possibly reflect, not have a weapon on him, etc., he begins to dance again.  Someone here mentioned the old cars and the man with the water bottle represents Michigan.  I agree to an extent.  I also agree with someone who stated the hazard lights on imply people who were pulled over by police and never able to return back to their cars again.  The old cars also could represent a time before social media, before people had the power of cameras to record what is going on in the streets.  In the end, he runs, with an impactful look of fear in his eyes.  We see people running behind him, though, and it doesn't exactly look or mean he's being chased by them; they could be running too, from the same thing.  Anyway, it's a great video.  Worth watching over and over and over and over....",0

6397,"**** MUST READ IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE VIDEO *****repost of EyeHabEbola's comment like his post if you see down amongst the commentsMy interpretation of this video as a white dude. I'm in no means right or wrong, so don't get offended or triggered, it's just the messages I got from the video:- From my point of view, I don't believe this video is about guns or gun violence per say; well obviously it does a little bit, but I don't think it's the main focus or message in the video. I think it has more to do with black on black violence and how oblivious people are to it; people don't seem to care that others are being shot up or stabbed in the streets on a daily basis and how little our government, politicians, and the black community are doing to solve it.- Another thing I got out of it was the ""get your money"" part. I thought with all the violence going on in the video that maybe the message was that people would do anything to get money; whether it means commiting crimes, stealing, joining gangs, etc because of how poor and uneducated they are. Like there is a desperation so people feel like the only way to get out of their situation is to commit crimes. - People are more concerned with themselves, whether it's their financial situation or careers or just life ingeneral, instead of caring about the things that are happening to people around them; hinting at how ignorant, arrogant, and close minded people are in our society today.- The distraction of him dancing while everything is going bat shit in the background represents how we only see and hear the perspectives we want to and that are infront of us instead of considering other points of view and looking at the whole picture; kind of like how liberals and conservatives stay in their echochambers instead of exploring other means of information and ideas. - I also think the dancing demonstrates how we put on a face or like try to cover up our problems; making it seem like everything is fine but it's actually not. It seems like they're having a good time but that's all for show, it's not actually how they feel.- A lot of people pointed out that the people singing were church singers; I think they look more like people who are graduting high school or college, looks more like a graduation gown to me which I thought was interesting. Possibly symbolizing that our education system isn't doing enough to protect our youth from violence in and out of school; could also be referring to school shootings and that the victims could have had a bright future ahead of them but it was cut short before even graduating.- We care to much about popular culture (dance moves, viral videos, rap songs, entertainment, celebrities, movies, etc). Also that we are so invested in escapism; living in fantasy lands created on a screen or in our heads instead of living and contributing to the real world we live in and the problems we need to solve.- Also that the kids dancing with Donald were like obsessed with what he was doing and obvious to the things taking place around them. For me it symbolizes how our youth look to pop culture figures as role models, copying and emulating what they do demonstrating how much influence pop culture figures have on the progression of our society and our youth. Also I think it symbolizes that we're always looking at other peoples lives instead of trying to fix and do something about our own.- Another thing I noticed was that the people in the background seemed to be somewhat aware of the shootings and things that are taking place but they aren't really doing anything about it, they're letting things happen which is just escalating the chaos. People are dying and no one seems to care, everything is moving so quickly; symbolizing how we as a society move on from things to fast thus delaying a solution that will stop that stuff from happening again in the future.- Also noticed how the cars were older and kind of beat up; for me it symbolizes poverty. Most of the car doors throughout the video were open like someone broke into them or maybe they were abandoned. There is actually a part around 1:20 were it looks like a dude is looking inside the car and grabbing something then running away. Also noticed people walking and stomping on them.- There are police cars but no police men in the video.- Also notice the gang members on the balcony with their phones filming either themselves or the people dancing. The message I got was that this gang or thug lifestyle is almost like romanticized by our music and media, making people want to he like those dudes with gold teeth and pistols in their hands driving lambos and doing drugs and such.- Noticed death on a white horse. In christianity, white horses symbolize death, but it also symbolizes freedom and power. The message I got was that power is achieved through death; maybe like politicians or people in power want people dying because that helps keep them in power. If there was a solution to violent crime and homicides etc, the politicians won't have an issue to campaign for. So they promise things will be fixed in order to get peoples votes but they never end up doing anything. They say they want to solve these problems and keep people from being killed, but in reality they don't want a solution because the longer they delay the solution the longer they'll be in power, if that makes any sense. Death on a white horse can also symbolize conflicts and wars over seas too, like the enemy needs to die in order to keep your power and influence.- I also noticed how the guns were being treated; set in a towel or whatever after being shot while the person who got shot was just dragged away and how donald just walks away from it like nothing happened. Personally I am a big 2nd amendment supporter and a member of the NRA, but I get the symbolism; caring more about our rights than about peoples lives. I, like many others, want to find ways to solve gun violence without infringing on our rights as americans. People don't realize there isn't a solution that will just magically and automatically get rid of this issue, but a combination of many solutions along with bipartisan agreement in my opinion will help combat and reduce gun violence. If we want to solve these problems, we need conversion and common ground; listening and understanding all of our viewpoints in order to come up with a viable solution that will please and appeal to everyone. Again, these are just the things I got out of the video, not right or wrong, just the things I interpreted and noticed",1

6422,"I find this music video quite ironic because yes, it's showing us how we're always distracted when there's violence occurring in America (like the dance shown in the music video and the kids video tapping), but I also feel like there's nothing that hinders the government at all to show the violence. It's not hidden from us and the government mostly favors leftist views and propaganda either way. It's the people who create a separation between race. We create the distraction and we are the cause of our own violence. Having a victim mentality and speaking through an inferiority complex doesn't establish unity. It is important for everyone to have a platform, which in this case there evidently is due to it trending and no the government isn't trying to hide this video for all who says so, but I disagree on the notion that we don't focus on these events. We have become desensitized to it. We need to fix our own people and stop depending on the government to fix everything.",0
6423,I feel like he has constant riots in the background because its like they are never ending.

Like, the only time he ever looks directly at someone else in the video are the 2 shooting scenes, and the 2 or 3 times he subtly looks over his shoulder at the school children. Each time he looks at them increases the tension, making you ask ""Is he going to shoot them or is he looking back out of concern?"" Which is how most people feel when they see someone open-carrying in the mall or a fucking playground.",1
6439,"Genius! The way we only focus on Gambino's and the dancers' happy faces while not noticing the chaos happening behind them purely explains the way we in real life comfortably enjoy material goods while million of people die of starvation, drug abuse and suicide around us which we do not want to admit as we are simply too egocentric and narcissistic.",0

6441,"I feel like the gospel scene could be referencing how initially white people used Christianity to spiritually enslave their hostages, denying them their own religions. As a result, Christianity has become enmeshed with southern African American culture, but in truth is an abhorrent of African tradition and a reminder of what slaves were forced to assimilate into. The hidden door opens and then violence is witnessed. it could also possibly reference how religious conditioning keeps people placated to the point that they don't put up a fight when faced with brutality, turning the other cheek leaves one defenseless. Maybe Gambino assassinating the choir is a way of saying ""Jesus didn't die for me, my ancestors did""",0
6442,"I dont know if he meant this or not, but did anyone notice how he clearly didnt have a gun on him in the first scene. It was obviously given to him by some person unknown.

They stripped his identity putting a bag over his head and the rope referencing lynches that happened so much in America and his statement is saying we went from lynching to just using guns now their is no difference. The fact he did it him self may also reference the idea of black on black violence doing it to each other that we as Americans are always saying.

6561,"I see, its complicated on first glance but its quite sensible looking on it. At first it appears to be (and it is in large) a reflection of black consciousness through the eyes of media and common 'american' day view of the world intersected with the common black american perception of real life inherited in the symbolism, chaos and order, themes of dominance, weed, dancing, pop culture ect that punctuates it. In a way it feels like i have read a typical american newspaper. Psychologically its like a call to be the hero in the psyche. To fight the darkness or the madness lit in plain light. A call for personal freedom through a presentation of a certain 'american' brand of madness visually represented for critique by the camera. Its extremely self aware. As if merely representing the state as seen is sufficient argument for the final end sequence. A door to a dark unknown. Away from the bright and well lit but constructed and containing warehouse. The escape into darkness is terrifying. It is the primordial unknown. But what is more terrifying is that people will either chase you out, chase you to drag you back in or run with you in a great (and chaotic) escape. Which is dramatically exactly what happens when someone is socially outcasted for thinking differently. I believe its all three at once, since only the subject (grover) is lit and everyone else is a blur or shadow. In a way its deeply psychological. I think the end represents all three of these options above as well as implying something perhaps more sinister.That when we escape --from others/ society-- into darkness it is chaos, and what we arrive at may not necessarily be better than what we are running from. This is the primordial terror of night that keeps us in the well lit  'warehouse'. Ofcourse once we arrive, the 'light' of consciousness (the camera) can shine on it then.But we must be the hero. It looks like glover is absolutely terrified into being the hero and facing the darkness. That it is not voluntary.  I like the feeling of stifling in that. As if we are put in between a rock and a hard place. Between the fear of society and the fear of the unknown. Of not being able to run fast enough away from our own and others madness. Perhaps due to how addictive it is once we silence our mind to it. It is after all nice to dance in the limelight.Politically speaking i see critiques of america, well thought out ones that emphasize a consciousness rather than a type of politics. Its extremely dark despite being so fun. Brilliant masterpiece of a single.",0

""You just a Black man in this world Drivin' expensive foreigns, ayy You just a big dawg, yeah I kenneled him in the backyard. No proper life to a dog .For a big dog"". to me it sounds like he's saying the gangster out there selling drugs and shooting peopel to drive those expensive foreign cars is living a life that isn't fit for a dog, killing and hurting its own, and will get them in jail (the kennel). And the main chorus is so indicitive of the distraction policy of the media. it goes from some stupid celebrity scandal (dont catch you slippin up) to talking about how fancy celebs are (look what im whippin up)",0

I also loved how he demonstrated the gun violence which America chooses to do nothing about. The young generation is brainwashed by popular Instagramers and popular youtubers and celebs. No one promotes education and being successful by using your brain and creativity. This new world is not good at all. This is the version of America for black people. Whites can benefit from the messege in the video as well, but the messege is definitely directed towards brainwashed blacks. The crazy dances he did is demonstration of the distraction the music industry puts on the young generation, and how a lot of black celebs shuck and jive like black face from back in the day making the white man happy while destroying themselves and their community being a sell out. People do anything for money these days no morals or respect for themselves or others. The world has become a big fat reality show courtesy of social media and people feeling like they have to share every single part of their private lives. I like how at the end he is running from all of that mess. It reminds me of the movie ""get out"". Lol.",0

This is an alternate hearing of these lyrics in particular. I'm so cold like yeah (yeah)I'm so dope like yeah (woo),We gon' blow like yeah From 1:25 - ""This is guerrilla yea yea ""(which sounds like warfare) -  Then you hear ""I'm so cola, (yea) I'm so dollar (yea) We goin blow like (yea) - In a generic stereotypical 'African' accent. At this point they do a dance move which according to a a youtube commenter is a North African dance. And then there are now two groups of kids, one is at the background, shooting money out of something red. At the same time you hear gunfire.If these alternate lyrics are not just pareidolia, here is the translation. In 1939 Coca Cola only had 5 overseas bottling plants. By 1945, they had 64. They had used the US military to advance their advertising of Coke, all the while saying that Coke was to be a distraction from the actual war (WW2) going on.  To help the troops think of home.  Yet it was really to open markets in new countries.  On the 29th June 1943 General Dwight D Eisenhower ordered three million bottles of Coca Cola to be sent to the allies in North Africa. Its well documented that in Tobruk Libya, American soldiers were willing to swap a bottle of whisky for three bottles of Coke. The distraction game and money game had really worked. A similarity to 2:15 Two groups of kids again-  he talks of the distractions via advertising, useless products & using our phones. New technologies, new distractions, we think its for us, but really its just another money game, power game. Maybe I""m just seeing too deep into things but hey, at least you learned something new today. :)",0

7609,"I just took a music class (college __) and I think Gambino is dancing like that because of a racist cartoon character that the white ppl made up called ÔJim crowÕ; the Jim Crow laws also cane from this name too. Jim Crow was a stereotype against black propel but was entertaining for the whites and I think that is what happening todayÕs society is worried about entertainment (sports, music, Tv) and all of the shootings are happening along with increase of suicideÕs AND the dancing also shows how kids and people in general are worried about the wrong things. ItÕs okay to have fun but get educated, not school book educated because that shit is fake! You gotta go to libraries and know what youÕre looking for, itÕs never too late , wake up!",1
7610,"Gambino has been known to use these types of symbolism in his music videos. In 3005, the people aged in the blurred background and things around him withered and died. In Sweatpants, Gambino used the ""extras"" to portray the effect of being in one's own head, surrounded by himself. Even in Bonfire there are multiple messages to be gotten from a rewind or two. Don't simply disregard those saying how the song is about the distractions and misdirection within our own media.The issues we need to talk about are always in the background to our entertainment media. Hour long policy-changing debate on gun control or hour worth of stupid trends all over the YouTube front page. The only thing I ask of this video is that it start discussion instead of being on social media for a week like Joyner Lucas' ""I'm Not Racist"" did.Learn from this, America.",0

7744,"""This is America"" analysis.A Thread. ( PLEASE CONTRIBUTE)Within "" This is America"" There are two major dichotomies of musical style. The first one we are introduced to is a tribalesque African track. Then suddenly, Childish Gambino shoots the black man, and then suddenly the track turns into a current day trap style of music.I believe that the song isn't just a statement about statements of gun control and other things such as the latest dance crazes, but rather what it is like for people of color (not just African Americans) to live in America.In the beginning we see that C.G (trying to save my character count) Is enjoying the tribal music, being personified by a black man playing a guitar. It's a part of him. He's dancing, he's moving, he's grooving. This is where the song takes a SUDDEN turn. He then shoots guitarmanWhen the personified music player dies, the beat takes a sharp turn into a modern trap beat. The first words of the entire song being ""This is America"" Symbolizing that the nation doesn't want the people to show their pride in their culture.It's also worth noting that the pose that CB takes while shooting his ""culture"" is a stance that mimics a famous Jim Crow stance. (Credits to @AngelKhalil for finding the picture) This is HUGE symbolism.Jim Crow, the personification of how African Americans should act. Is literally killing his own culture and heritage as a way of appeasement to the hierarchy. Or rather. To America.The following lines ""Dont catch you slippen up"" refer to watching yourself. Not striving away from what is accepted. C.G is personifying Jim Crow himself, showing the internal struggle of being what the people want him to act and how he himself wants to act.The next big noteworthy thing is the dancing. While in his ""Appeasing"" self, C.G surrounds himself with the youth of the current African Americans. He's choosing to not show them the realness of their culture. Hes not showing the tribal beat we started with, but rather the trap.These children aren't dancing to the traditional music of their culture. They're listening to the new America. The new african culture. They're mimicing Gambino's moves. Creating new ""dance crazes"" rather than focusing on what isn't being shown to them.The next scene depicts  black culture again. The trap music is gone, replaced by the voices of the choir. The tribal theme has returned. CG then returns to the focus of the scene. He's dancing, he enjoying himself. he's SMILING. He's himself again.The only time CG is seen smiling or enjoying himself is when he's able to express himself through his actual culture. When he has to be this tool for America he doesn't look like he's enjoying himself. But here, with the choir. He's able to be himself.Until... He can't be himself anymore. An Assault rifle is tossed to him (presumably by America itself"" and he guns down the entire choir, the representation of his culture. And he reminds us. ""This is America"" He's forced back into the form of Jim Crow. Appeasing to America.The same process as earlier occurs. Dancing with children to the trap music and ignoring the true culture of himself. Except now, there's a little bit more going on in the background. There's fires. Riots. Death.But throughout all the chaos going on in the background, the camera stays focused on CG. This is what you should be paying attention to. Here, in America, we aren't concerned with the REAL problems going on around us. But rather more concerned with the latest dance craze.I think what happens next is an IDEAL America to CG. Following the crazyness of the reality of America, there is a brief pause. A moment for just himself. To relax. And then he pulls out a joint (CG is known to love Joints for smoking)Following the moment for himself. CG climbs upon a car and counts down. This time, neither the tribal beat or the trap beat plays. But rather, for the first time in the song. BOTH tracks play.Gambino erupts into dance. He's expressing himself the best way he knows how. He accepts that he can no longer appease only to what others (America) wants, but rather he has to show what he wants. There's something different in this dance though. It's no longer pure bliss.It's passion. He's not smiling when dancing but you can feel his soul exploding from his movements. Using both tribal and contemporary moves. As the camera slowly pans away. This is the best way to live in America in his head. Using both your culture and the ""culture of America""Except.. It isn't the perfect way. The camera repans in to focus of CG. It's different now. There isn't really music. Just Ambient sounds, and a kick drum. There's tension in the music . No reolution. No dancing. No smiling. He's running. Seemingly frightened out of his mind.Behind him. A crowd forms, but it isn't clear who is chasing him. There's just... people. This is America. The people you can't see coming after you. Even though he thought he found a good middle ground to be himself and who they wanted him to be. It wasn't good enough.This is America.Don't catch you slippen up.https://twitter.com/joshmoonboy/status/993648134352850944This is my thread on twitter about the analysis of this video.

I mean come on the  civil war was over 100 years ago. Also guns are meant to protect people but when they are in the hands of someone who is not sane then bad things happen and just because you point out a couple instances where people were killed with guns doesn't mean that we need to get rid of them. Also if guns were banned then we would have no way to stop these shooters. This video is so left sided that it's not even funny,0

7989,I really admired how he portrayed the first part of the video where a man is doing absolutely nothing but playing his guitar but then his head is covered in a bag signifying how people assume African Americans are engaging in something bad. That leads to so much pressure on them because of the threats from police which back agains refers to the head in the bag which literally holds no escape. At the end the man gets shot because of racial profiling. Such a powerful message.,0

Like Richard Pryor did, like Eddie Murphy did when he did the stand-up specials__ ""Delirious"" and ""Raw,"" Chris Rock, and has the potential to become a Dave Chappelle-genius-like figure. And getting to the Chappelle level of genius is no mean feat. Using comedy to address societal issues, in such a way that not only brings the crowd to the point of laughing in tears, but also presenting ideas that would change the world if they were put to use. I would love to see Glover/Childish Gambino become another Dave Chappelle-type, who finally ""hammers home"" the awareness/action nail, that Chappelle positioned, and tapped into alignment.__And Glover-Gambino has some moves!____",0

They can be shot and killed, no big deal does not matter, just bring the $$$ / sales for us with music. His hands were tied, trying to say that they are prisoners of America_ The fact that we focus on him in the video and not in the background represents us in real life. Distracted and not noticed, what happens behind the scenes. We only notice that when a shoot happens in the video, for barely a second, then we get distracted, just like in real life._ The men in the ski masks represent those of us who experience cruelty and chaos and just sit back and record it live on Snapchat or Insta or FB - watch it all happen without real righteous action_ Dancing represents trends - how people are consumed by the latest and newest trends, like blind followers in a trance, who are up to date with meaningless songs about drugs and money and sex, new dances, entertainment and fads, gossip and all other things Surface - not really connect withInstagram : aka.bizzy",0

What should I expect. This is precisely why music is dead as far as mainstream shit. Has been since pretty much 1996. When Blues no longer influences music, this is the result, the video is better than anything musically that artist can do. You ask me, heÕd be better off as a poet, screen writer maybe.

Politicians and extremism shouldn't have control over our lives here. We're here to live full and happy lives in America. I honestly believe politicians aren't good for much in this world (if you take out a politician right now what else could they do except be a man/woman of words? They aren't good for shit and they're corrupt, fake assholes) and they're the root of all our problems. I don't know what the solution is to these issues but we should demand better. It isn't enough that we can say ""At least we aren't a third world country with real problems."" we should strive for better no matter what state our country is in. There are just too many integral issues in this country that are left up to stupid politicians to get done. Gun violence has to go down. Racism must be eradicated. These are issues that we shouldn't worry about anymore. We can't become insensitive to it all we have to do something about it. I'm glad for artists like Gambino that help us remind ourselves of the shit we're in no matter if we're impacted by it or not. These are the genuine people that have seen conflict first hand and have the chance to solve our issues. We just have to keep going at it. We can't ever forget that these issues exist until they're completely eradicated. Something has to be done, although I don't know how or what. People, rise up.",1

8677,"Dropping amid ongoing political and cultural tumult and turmoil, Childish GambinoÕs ÒThis is AmericaÓ appears to be a commentary on black life in America and American culture as a whole. It contrasts popular cultureÕs perception of black experience and its often brutal reality by juxtaposing happy, carefree choruses and dark, aggressive verses.This contrast may also allude to the cyclical shifts in mood whenever there is a shooting in America. One second, the entire nation is in an uproar, the next, they are happy and unconcerned, placated by pop culture trends.In the music video, directed by frequent Gambino collaborator Hiro Murai, Gambino portrays this comparison by dancing around gleefully, seemingly unbothered by the chaotic scenes of violence in the background. However, in the short filmÕs final scene, Gambino is seen running frantically through a darkened warehouse trying to escape the mob that now chases him, a reminder that if America chooses to remain ignorant to its problems, eventually they will catch up to us.",0

Luckily most of the population is white right now and it would be suicide to attack them but when the terrorist groups like BLM start shooting whites in the streets, I hope the people with the most power will stop bending over and realize thie shit ain't real white people are as much a 'problem' as jews were in Nazi Germany.

9138,"He done it again.... this video has so much going on it can be interpreted many ways by many people it all depends on perspective,  like for me... the dancing in the front of the camera with the chaos just symbolizes the distraction from what's behind us while we're focused on the party life... the people running constantly and aimlessly throughout the video can be looked at as the desire for the average american to want to live the fast life (or actually loving that life) while lacking sense of direction or genuine purpose... the killings are obvious, the 17 seconds of silence is obvious, the marijuana during the 17 seconds could mean the popular belief of mj healing powers or the increasing trend of its use and how he goes from killing to dancing again shows how one minute we're plagued by these senseless terroristic acts by the negro haters but then we soon forget about these acts as we continue to party and chase the fast life... the ending I'm not so sure about just yet.

And I understand what he was trying to do, but IÕm tired of people taking such a definitive stance in view of the American black experience. When we continue to show people that this is what we are, they will truly believe that this is what we are.

The murder of the choir and murder of the guitarist symbolises the death of actual culture/good music and that being overthrown by this new age mumble rapping or what I like to call flex rapping.... The killing in the video shows how modern day America deals with problems...whether it be internal or external... America deals with problems with violence ( this is my opinion and I am possibly incorrect in assuming this).... America or rather the world need to be saved.... Drugs....

9594,"The actual meaning behind childish GambinoÕs.....this is America Clearly in the beginning, Gambino is representing an individual with a mental illness. One can interpret this from the way he walks, and the facial expression used during the first 15 seconds. This is fallowed by a representation of how strengthening gun laws will not solve any problems, as clearly the man with mental illness (who would not be able to get a gun through legal means in todayÕs America) achieves a gun illegally off the street from another man, and then uses said gun to commit the murder. This scene could also represent the ever increasing black on black gang violence that is so prevalent in the inner cities of America.  As clearly this is a inner city setting like Chicago or Baltimore etc. as the students are wearing uniforms, and uniforms are most commonly used in inner cities schools. Based on the execution style of murder  this demonstrates that itÕs  a gang related turf war, (one gang leader taking out another). Him handing the gun off at the end is more evidence the gun was purchased illegally because he is removing fingerprints were as if the gun was legal it would track back to you either way.  Through serial numbers etc. The next scene I would like to point out is the church scene, again clearly Gambino is representing a man with mental illness once again  Who achieves a gun illegally and commits a crime, this is interpreted by the same means as before, his walk, facial expression, illegally purchase of fire arm etc. Also notice how the police after responding to the shooting did not assume Gambino was the murderer instead they ran right by him to investigate the case and come up with a suspect. The video represents very nicely how everyone in America is innocent till proven guilty. The next scene I would like to discuss is the suicide scene clearly the video is  showing that the main stream media is focusing on gun violence and mass shootings making it seem like itÕs more of a concern then the major increased spike in suicides as demonstrated by very few people noticing the suicide the first time through but everyone noticing the mass shooting scene. In reality in 2017 590 people died from mass shootings in the United States. 44,965 people died from suicides in that same year. ThatÕs a big difference. Also notice how not one cellphone or camera was focused on the guy who commits suicide even after he had jumped instead the cameras remain focused on the main media objective. As we get close to the end the next  point I would like to make is the dating of the video clearly this is a video demonstrating what it was like decades ago, when racism and prejudice was prominent through America. This is shown by the old style vehicles, clothing and technology demonstrated throughout the video. But this has since improved dramatically to almost nothing except a few idiots and a**holes known as the KKK.  The final point this video demonstrates is the fair treatment the police offer. clearly after the investigation it was found that Gambino was in fact the criminal and I would consider him armed and dangerous, as he had already killed over 8 people. While Gambino is trying to run away from the police you donÕt see the police shoot him in the back as so many media outlets accuse the police of doing, no you see them chasing after him trying to arrest him, unless he was to stop and pull a gun the police would not fire. This tells me the video wants to show that the police are doing there jobs correctly getting criminals off the streets. Also the is a good representation the marijuana should still be, and always should be punishable by jail time, and that it should never be legalizedPersonally I feel this video is one of the most pro American videos on YouTube, clearly we arenÕt perfect as represented by our past, but our present and future look good and America is clearly on the right track and number one and if we could just get the media to report the news and let us form our own opinions instead of formulating there own opinions and forcing it on the few issues we do have as a country would vanish.",0

But... itÕs in a blur, and all of the focus is on DONALD (the celebrity).He repeatedly says ÒIÕm so prettyÓ, similar to how a celebrity puts no input into the state of America, and is more worried about themselves on the camera meanwhile chaos is breaking loose behind them.",0

This is self-segregation, as if the only group of people that can enjoy his work have to be black. It further seperates black people from other races. His video portrays Blacks in America as victims of police brutality, so when a black man or woman is arrested, the first thing that everyone thinks is that there is racism at play. No one stops to think about the crime committed. Granted, the police isn't always in the right, but we must look at all sides of the story and not the one that we've been taught to believe based on videos like this.  It's as if Glover's video is promoting blind thought, and not critical thinking. People living in America need to stop thinking of themselves as black, white, latino, asian, or any other race and start thinking of themselves as Americans.",0

I think it's simplistic to just put one simple meaning on this song/video, he came gloves off on many subjects imo, and i think it's a conversation we need to have.........key word being CONVERSATION - not a damn hate-filled argument with each side calling names and refusing to let others talk or getting hyper defensive, we need to have a real conversation with each other about wtf has gone on, and what is still going on in this country in relation to race, racism, and classism.

9948,This is very true about America the people are blinded by the trends and dances. And canÕt see the real issues in the world. People care more about guns then their own people. As you see IÕm the video everything he shot somebody came and wrapped the gun in red cloth (red America) and handled it with care. And as I mentioned about the trends they have the dancers there for a reason to distract you from the violence thatÕs going on in the background which represents people being blinded by trends. ThereÕs also lots of spiritual dances in here that existed during slavery times so that explains the dancing. And in the beggining his position when he shot the dude his position resembled this old painting of a black dude in an crow like position that was painted during Jim Crow laws. I hope America gets better,0

If you go see reaction videos of this, everyone has same reaction, everyone is happy when he is dancing, but when he shot that man/choir, mood just dropped. ""Don't catch you slippin' now"", i think that means, when you finally forget something bad happened and you are getting happy again, he kills and brings you back to reality ""don't catch you slippin' now"", because there is shit going on around you all the time.Second thing, 1:48 , he comes out dancing and all happy, but his mood drops and he kills choir.

10119,"Would 1000% recommend listening with headphones. Everything about this piece is beautiful, shocking, necessary. Donald Glover is one of the most influential artists of our generation and not to discredit the incredible direction by Hiro Murai as well. I hope everyone can understand and reflect on what Donald is saying... and not just see this for its face value as a cool song and video... pay attention to everything. It's not just the song that 'is America' it's the piece as a whole. The difference in the overall tone of the music at different parts and the dramatic shift when the people are killed, followed by ""this is America"" each time. Pay attention to how the music before and after makes you feel and how Donald distracts from each shooting by taking up camera space immediately after. And the ending scene...... terrifying..... I think this video embodies an incredibly disturbing message... I thought about Donald's past themes about what it means to be a ""celebrity"" and having an elevated status in our society and how that can both give someone a platform but also make them a misrepresentation of the average citizen. I understood this song to be reflecting on the huge difference between how Donald Glover, an African-American songwriter and artist, is treated in this country with the fame and constantly being praised.... and how the average African-American citizen is treated. I believe he is portraying himself as this misrepresentation of the African-American citizen in the United States, taking up camera space dancing with those kids while the rioting and chaos in the background is totally disregarded and ignored... I'm also understanding that the guns in the video are referring to not only the huge issue of violence in America but also our country's talent at covering things up and distracting from things that really matter... constantly warping and skewing everything through mass media.A long explanation I know but please PLEASE tell me that there are other reasonable people out there who are picking up on this... I need to know that this will be talked about and NOT be dismissed as just ""Childish Gambino's new song"". This is a piece of art with a deep purpose and message and THANK YOU Donald for this it is what we FUCKING NEED with all this other bullshit going on. And for those reading... please write back: what do you think the ending means?? I think it has something to do with Americans both loving and devouring African-American culture but at the same time being violent and racist and having prejudice towards the same group of people... makes no fucking sense. I read the scene as Donald running from the people of America. Kinda like he is a celebrity with an elevated status but maybe he's asking: when will America start treating him with that violence and prejudice too... Like he is running for his life.... that scene is actually terrifying... anyways please realize how important this video is and write back to me! I genuinely want this video to be talked about in the best way. Bless all.",1

The people that get shot are the innocent that have no reason to die. Just minding their own business and doing their own thing. The dancing, just a distraction from whatÕs really happening in the real world. Kids dancing while in the back of our heads know that people are dying everyday not just by drive byÕs but by mass shootings, and terrorists. As a young teen, weÕre distracted everyday by just the little things to cover up the big picture. The running away in the end shows the future. How that dancing is going to go away. The bills, the job, the family, the stress of adult life mixed with the insecurity of your survival because of your religion and/or skin color. It will haunt you and come back to you no matter who you are or what you do. ItÕll come back and youÕre gonna start running. Not dancing.",0

10263,"*3 unpopular theories...**THEORY #1:  Glover is attacking capitalism.*Americans worship capitalism(what he's singing about ""get the bag etc"") while society burns down around them.  The ruthless are glorified and the meek die in this culture.  He premiered this on Marx's 200th birthday on snl.  In the video, he has a large beard that resembles Marx's beard.  If he's playing him in the video, then it would be as if the ghost of Marx is mocking capitalism(and its liberal gun laws) and what it is doing to society.  Glover himself is also very left leaning.*THEORY #2:  Glover is critiquing Black America, specifically the youth.* In the video, the black youth worship gangster culture i.e. murder for money, while their society burns down around them.  They follow ""the famous rapper"" who sings about murder and money while ignoring their community burning down around them.  In other words, the video would really be ""This Is *Black* America"" and would be closely related to J. Cole's ATM.    *THEORY #3:  Glover has joined the illuminati and this video is predictive programming for the masses.*  In the video, Americans in general worship and chase money, power, & celebrity, while ignoring their country burning down around them.  Soon society will completely collapse and a war will start and kill everyone with missiles.  The war is symbolized when Glover stops and everything gets silent.  Then he pulls out a blunt and lights it, symbolizing a missile blasting off. Like I saidÉ unpopular.",0

10280,"My interpretation of the video (I'm typing from mobile so it's hard for my to bring up time marks while typing forgive me)First thing I noticed was how right after he shoots and commits murder, We are immediately distracted by these kids who are doing dances that are popular from social media. These same kids are also the ones who clean up the mess and cover up his mess basically. In my opinion this represents how whenever we get a mass shooting or tragedy (especially when Blacks are the victim) in the news as if almost immediately we collectively get distracted by some  less relevant in media.He shoots up a church that gets covered up again this time we see a police car but with no police officer present. I feel like this represents how our Police don't really help almost as if they're not really there in most cases. Because the police car in the video is in full view to see what Childish just did but nothing is being done. Notice how the line right before the choir is killed is ""Get your money, Black Man"" it's stopped abrubtly by the shooting. This can also represent how Black people are systematically opressed that they can't get success because the system (gun) keeps it from happening.Going back to the kids whenever we see them dance there is a lot of chaos going on in the background. Also another representation of the media trying to distract us from what's actually going on in the world.We see kids on the roof with their cellphones out watching and recording everything happening not doing anything. It's pretty self explanatory but they represent us as a society who would rather record stuff than actually helpWe also see a man in Black riding a white horse. Now if you know the story of the Four horseman of the apocalypse this could either represent the first horse which is Conquest but seeing the context of the video and the rider being draped in black it could be the last horse which represent Death meaning the end of the world or apocalypse.Towards the end we see Childish dancing as if it's a victory for the chaos he just caused. This could represent anything but it is something that stands out especially seeing this is the only part where it's calm Then the very end we see him running away from a mob of people. In my opinion I think the mob represents the American people who basically had enough with the chaos that's been happening lately in our country. And Childish is that chaos personified.Also this may sound weird but seeing how the song has a Kanye West vibe to it... I low-key think Childish is suppose to represent Kanye in a way I don't know whyAgain this is just my take feel free to add more",0

Like, I know that he's more than capable of profound lyricism and could have just approached it with that tool, but I think he wanted people to listen to it that normally wouldn't. I can't tell you how many people I've met that won't listen to any hip hop unless it's super trapped out. It's like, the song is going to get radio play with all those other songs and someone is going to google the video and be like ""oh...well that wasn't what I thought it was"" and maybe reexamine their attraction to all the other music like that flooding the airwaves.It's no secret that record labels push violent, negative hip hop to the mainstream over any other type. Too Short used to make conscious rap and said in an interview that record labels basically told him, no you need to make more of that other shit because that's what we're going to sell.Idk, I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but part of me feels like that has been done purposely with the intent to discredit the power of the music. And I'm not even saying that the darker shit isn't powerful or valid or artistic, just that I feel like there should be other aspects represented. Even the classic gangster rappers used to make empowering tracks from time to time that got mainstream air time. It seems like those days are over.",1

I blame  the news for blowing up SPECIFIC events to push laws they are in favor in and repeating it so it becomes stuck in your head. It's true that if you repeat something enough times you start to believe it's actual fact. The funny and Scary thing is just how little the amount of times it's repeated for people to believe in it. I also partly blame PEOPLE for simply believing everything CNN/NBC and all these social figures on youtube  say without looking at opposing ideas or statistical evidence that contradicts them. I feel like racism is just turning into like a trendy thing that people can rally behind for fun or to virtue signal instead of trying to solve real issue if there was one.",0

11959,THIS IS BLACK AMERICA....DANNY GLOVER'S SON,0
11960,"I recant my initial statement about this video and song. The intro speaks to what this song is about. In summation, this song is about the ""Life is a party"" mentality that is currently prevalent among Black people as a whole: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahYeah, yeah, yeah, go, go awayWe just wanna partyParty just for youWe just want the moneyMoney just for you (yeah)I know you wanna partyParty just for meThis denotes the mentality that is pervasive among Black people in America and worldwide.  How did it get this way, you may ask? It go this way through music, which is denoted by the Man playing the guitar in the opening of the video. It started with the Disco Era, where it was party all of the time, ""Having a good ole time"", which morphed into Rap, which morphed into Gangster Rap (denoted by the gang violence in the background), which morphed into the madness that is labelled as ""Black"" music today. I do not know Mr. Glover's stance on 2A, whether he is pro or con. This  brings me to the scene when the Choir is gunned down; to me, this symbolizes the loss in knowledge, which goes back to the opening mantra: ""Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahYeah, yeah, yeah, go, go away. I my opinion, ALL rap is bad because it is superficial and does not address solutions to the multiple problems that are of our own doing, this is why Mr. Glover had the Pale Horse galloping in  the background, we are a whole have become DEATH and it is time for us to own up to the reality of this and strive to become better people through individual effort. The cars to me represent us existing in foreign ideologies pretending to travel to better positions while actually going nowhere. The Cadillac towards the end of the video are there to represent what we have abandoned; leaving sound easy living behind in search of the latest trend, fad or madness that ALWAYS bring further destruction to Black people. Mr. Glover running at the close of the video, represents fleeing from the madness, like a ""runaway slave"". In essence, we collectively have become Coons, Jim Crows; SELL-OUTS! Guns are NOT the issue in the two scenes where they are used, because guns just like every other inanimate object are subject to the USER'S will.  The Red clothe represents the blood on the hands of those who have used guns to murder off some of our people; they are WORSE than the Ku Klux Klan. The objective when it comes to gun violence is the loss of respect for Black Life among us as a people and we have no one to blame but ourselves. ENOUGH WITH THE IRRESPONSIBLE VICTIM NARRATIVE!",0

12105,"OK..SO...I just want to make sure I'm interpreting and or understanding the message of this song and video, what Childish Gambino is actually trying to say that is. Feel free to correct me or add your insight/opinion to mine in reply to this comment. My comment is purely for understanding purposes only. (feel like I need to put disclaimers before everything I do or say these days to avoid unnecessary triggering, offense, and misinterpretation....which is sad in of itself, but there I did it).       This is what I see when I watch this video (I do not necessarily agree with everything I'm about to write here all I'm saying is that this is what I think Childish Gambino is trying say):  Gun violence is everywhere and causing pain and terror. A solution many are going with is we need to arm up to defend ourselves (the main character in the video says I'm strappin). The church/organized religion/church buildings primarily exist to take your money. Childish Gambino doesn't like church for this reason and shot the choir (which represents church) as a demonstration of his dislike for church. In order to deal with this violence epidemic people are drugging(heroin) and dancing(partying and literally dancing) their way through it to get through it. Or they're just straight up running away from it like at the very end. (the final solution is to run in terror or at least that's what most people are doing and where we're all at right now). I feel like there's a race message in there somewhere, but it's too muddled for me to make out/see it. So I can't tell if Donald Glover is making a point about race(Gun Violence is primarily affecting black people?) or if he's just commenting on our society from the perspective of an African American. Since I didn't see a single white, Asian, or whatever other race in the video except occasionally in the background. But I think the central/bottom line theme in the video is that Gun Violence is everywhere and it's a problem that's affecting and hurting people. Did I miss anything? Are any of my above interpretations or take-aways invalid? (If so please provide your reasoning). What do you see? What do you take away from this video?*EDIT: After further research it looks like the choir shooting was a reference to the Charleston shooting not church taking your money. But I guess it could be interpreted either way. Still, most likely paying homage to the Charleston church shooting.",0

This also ties into the hook ""This is America, don't catch you slippin up"" which i feel like is talking about how black people could do something against the law or not and even if it isn'y worth police killing them they get targeted anyways",0

Nothing but meaningless entertainment just like most of today's music and music videos.Or...Donald Glover is trying to send a message about black on black crime in America from the perspective of a black man. Notice how HE is the one doing all the shooting and mock shooting and he only shot black people. He's dancing around all non nonchalant with no shirt on and smoking weed....very symbolic of black males living in inner city neighborhoods.",0

12198,"Well, since it seems a lot of people are interpreting this kinda differently than I am, Imma leave my opinion here:This is mostly a mocking of the idea that ''America'' is a perfect place above all others, where violence is an exception and only seen as fiction, or something from foreign cultures. It mocks the idea that there is a separation between the USA and ''third world countries'' when in the end, all of those things do happen in the US, yet we only treat it as exceptions. And in the same way, black culture is treated like entertainment, and many see it as something that only exists in fiction. These things do exist, and they are not just for your entertainment. And both happen far away from the average white person's eyes for a reason. The exposure cultures that are ''foreign'' to the average american get nowadays is not to be taken for granted as something 100% positive. It is good that we have that, but that's not changing the fact that a lot of people can just look at these things from far away without understand them, and the fact that they're part of America and happen within our own borders.But I might be just overthinking here, I'm drunk and sleepy.",0

12235,"ItÕs funny to see the ppl that say they thinks itÕs trash & donÕt get the video. I think itÕs very poetic. One thing the video touches on is gun violence. 1. Person getting shot in beginning and after heÕs done, the child takes it. Speaks on how easy it is for any of us to get them. Grown and young.2. All the dances and song references were used to show how easily our attention is diverted to the tv shows, music, dances, etc to pull our attention away from serious matters. Every time something major happens that threatens us, some ÒEVENTÓ happens to pull focus away from it (Kanye, Finals, etc.)3. Choir singing and he comes in with AK and kills them. Walks away from scene and past police & vehicle... SOUND FAMILIAR? Church shooting? Kid walking away like from the responsibility of what he did and America, once again, moves on. 4. When the voice says ÒYou owe me!Ó, that could be China or any other country weÕve stolen from or lended to us (which is why you see the cars - foreign or parts made by foreigners)I could go on but I got all of this if my first view.

12239,"The way I view this video is as a social commentary of America. I'm not sure what the guy with the bag over his head represents (maybe CIA torturing in the Middle East, something about a civil rights person who was murdered that way earlier or recently, idk) but the shooting of the black choir was quite clear and the fact that he made a metaphoric gun with his fingers that caused the schoolkids in uniform to run away while saying ""bang"" instead of actually having the gun noises like the other shootings did was quite clear. I must say that I am glad that he did not shoot the kids because that would be too soon and just not right for such a wonderful video. Also, I just remembered, the visuals of the people rioting vs police with burning cars and whatnot after each shooting was also very clear. I believe that Donald and the kids are the example of the unaffected public just strolling through all of the peripheral horrors going on in the country and then the reason that the schoolchildren leave are because they are finally affected by it too (school shootings), leaving just the unaffected public. Also, the visual of Donald shooting people could also point to him low-key saying that the public who are ignoring the issues or refusing to do anything about it (gun violence) are basically shooting and killing the affected with their own hands.NOT SAYING I AM RIGHT, just my thoughts.

12277,"I love how he fused the South African imagery, sounds and dance and even the gospel part with the American . I believe there's a reason for this. I personally believe that South Africa is the one African country whose overall situation can be slightly compared to the American, all the way from racial issues to being one of the most developed countries in the region where everyone wishes to go. Now I also think that there's a reason for him to use the AK47 in the video. It's known that the AK 47 is one of the most used(commercialized) weapons in the world, in the Southern African region it's not uncommon for criminals to use AKs for highjackings house roberies etc.  Mozambique(which is also in the Southern Africa region) has an AK47 in it's national flag. So I believe that Donald is in a very indirect manner comparing or bringing up all this similarities for a reason. This is more than a statement about Black Americans it's about Black Africans as well. You can see the kids dancing in the uniform in most african countries public schools it's a rule for kids to wear uniforms, that should explain the kids in the back. Once again, I believe that he's trying to show the crazy similar we black people can be, irrespective of where you might be from. We all make culture, hence why the mixture of rapping(american) with the more african guitar sounds, the American dances with central and southern African dance style, south African choir style with the Black American choir style,  and finally he seems to add a little of James Brown at the end of the video perhaps to add an effect of going back in time(idk honestly) but the Cars are also old school models of which I think I saw a BMW which was maybe still is very used again in South Africa, in places like Soweto(a neighborhood where the majority are black inhabitants) that BMW is known as ""Gusheshe"" which means spinner If I am not mistaking(because they use it to make doughnuts/stunts in public).  lol sorry for the long reply but you wanted to know what was going on in the video and that's all I saw lol",0

It's all onpoint, and this is America.   The pursuit of money drives alot of the violence pertaining to gangs and drugs. There's violence against blacks, cops killing blacks, black on black, white on white, and mass killings.  We need to just stop watching violence like it's inevitable and come up with solutions.  The Bible said these days would come and they're here,  and the world is coming to an end, but that doesn't mean that we don't fight evil, wrong, and injustice.

12674,"My thoughts are, the video is weird af but unique in a good way, the song has some good meaning to it too I like the beats, ok so I live in America... America is a free county, so they want us to believe anyways, we are the freest most communist country, we are controlled by taxes/money in general,  if we don't pay them we will get in trouble and pay have to pay more money, most of the music people make is corrupting our youth and making them hell, the federal government doesn't like cannabis because it helps with cancer patients and a lot of other medical things so they don't want it legalized, the heath organization makes millions or even billion off cancer patients by chemotherapy, the food they give us in the stores have a bunch of gmos and sh*t like that so it makes us sick and have to go get medical treatment so more money for the government, the lower class/ middle class have to work until they die, if there lucky they will get out by getting famous or something or if they grind hard enough but that puts stress on the body and mental, so they go to the doctor... more money for the government, kids bully most of the time because they have there own problems, that creates more problems for the victims and can do serous affects to them, the government doesn't care though, schools are controlled by the government so how do we know the stuff there teaching us is useful or good to know, they teach kids sh*t they don't need to know for 12-14 years of our life and then expect us to know how to life, if kids don't go the parents will get in trouble, so we are forced to learn shit we don't need to know, some of it we need to know but our parents/Guardians should teach us the things we need to know, our phones have cameras for the government to watch us, the location future on it tracks our every movement cause there always on us, the mic on it can hear what we're talking about, there is a lot more, BTW I'm 14 and I almost fully understand how corrupted America and the world has been and just keeps getting worse I'm ready for it to hopefully get better but It probably wont, and I'm ready to start over our world/life in general cause this world and life is pointless we live to pay and then just go though a lot of shit through the way and then just die, don't get offended cause this is just how it is",1

12989,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand This Is America. The message is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of institutional racism most of the verses will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Donald's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from political corruption, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these lyrics, to realize that they're not just catchy- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike This is AmericaÊtruly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the brilliance in Donald's existencial catchphrase ""Get your money black man,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to black-on-black crimesÊI'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Donald Glover's genius unfolds itself on their iphone screens. What fools... how I pity them. __ And yes by the way, I DO have a Childish GambinoÊtattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",0

13223,"This song was great and all, but Achy Breaky Heart can make any album a #1 album in America. The Beatles? Pink Floyd? Tupac? Who? None of these artists have ever made anything as good as Billy Ray Cyrus's Achy Breaky Heart. The song itself transcends reality and time, it reaches the fifth dimension with Cyrus's lyrical genius which was heavily influenced by the Beastie Boys. Migos have cited Billy Ray Cyrus as a huge influence in their work. The ""Migos flow,"" a triplet rhythm in modern rap, can be seen first used in Achy Breaky Heart. Scientists use Achy Breaky Heart to fairly review and compare all albums and songs. Kendick Lamar's 'To Pimp a Butterfly' was given 94/100 Achy Breaky Hearts. The album that's ever reached the closest to 100 Achy Breaky Hearts was Pink Floyd's 'The Dark Side of the Moon,' an album that starts and ends with 30 seconds of Achy Breaky Heartbeats; the album recieved 99/100 Achy Breaky Hearts. It was supposed to be perfect, but a point was reduced for not being Achy Breaky Heart by Billy Ray Cyrus. The song has become a staple part of human culture, with the ancient Mayans sacrifices their war captives to Billy Ray Cyrus by feeding the sun god their Achy Breaky Hearts. In the 2018 movie, 'The Black Panther,' upon close inspection, every song in the soundtrack can be linked to Achy Breaky Heart. This is why Achy Breaky Heart is the greatest song of all time.",0

AND then the church killing at 1:54 that also happened in real life, this again reminse of the Charlestone church shooting back in 2015 where a kid called Dylann Roof murdered 9 African American's and tried to race a war. At 2:13 you notice a white man in the background falls down and white people are running and that the children who are dancing the howl time are destracting everything. At 2:34 you see a guy (Death) on a horse, the meaning of it is that also hell is following death and destruct everything on their way.

13959,"This song is clearly telling the facts in front of everyone's face. It has the horse of death, the shooting of the gospel singers telling us about Dylan roof shooting up the black church in Charleston South Carolina, also telling us how celebrities and entertainment is a distraction from what is really going on in this world. Humans are to ignorant to see that these celebrities work for Lucifer and no one can get rich or famous without making a deal with Lucifer because Lucifer was the Prince of music in heaven and now he runs this world to bring as many souls as possible to hell. It's very important to get to know Jesus Christ because he is our Lord and savior. He is the only one who can give us salvation in order to get in heaven but most people are are to dumb down to notice we're in spiritual warfare and clearly this is the end of days. People are lovers of the flesh and without Jesus Christ the world is damned to hell while very few make it into heaven. All people have to do is research the world of lies we live in such as the music industry exposed, selling the soul to Satan for riches and fame, magicians exposed and guided by demons, freemasons, mk ultra and there is so many more topics that can lead a person to the truth because GOD knows many people are blinded and sound asleep",0

Every now and again, a racial incident or an expression of art makes us pause and reflect, but we soon return to dancing, return to the avoidance that we crave.

We hear about death and we think damn that's crazy, then post a dog filter selfie and dank memes on social media and we're numb to the fact that things are systematically collapsing all around us. We think religion is stupid and we are our own gods and nobody can judge us. We do what we want and you really have to put in effort to make us act even at the face of disgusting injustice. We are numb, we slaves to the money, slaves to attention, slaves to ""beauty"", slaves to entertainment, slaves within a sleeping society that simply rolls over when we get smacked in the face. Like ok, yeah you go ahead and do that cause I'm too busy to even bother. Yeah, you go on and walk free after shooting us point blank in the head after a simple traffic stop. Yeah, you go on, carry on good sir, after choking us to death, go on and do it. I don't condone it but I got work early tomorrow morning. You go on ahead, and steal from my labor to fund a war that will kill my child, that you persuaded to join cause it was ""noble"". I won't stop you cause I lack the will and I need my next paycheck. Go on ahead and blame the foreigner for your shortcomings, I'd rather hate on my low income non-English speaking neighbor next door than to start asking the Pentagon about my lost change. You carry on sir, cause I got to keep the hamster wheel running. Work, work, work to get a lifetime wage worth less than half of the fighter jet crashed in the testing site. You go on. Cause I chose to get on this boat and I shackled myself in right? I've chosen to remain a citizen here, and I've chosen to partake in the cultural tradition of debt.

TheyÕre not like the typical rap cars you see in videos. 5) kids on their cellphones represent how  passive we are when things happen in front of us. There has been many occasions when something fatal could have been stopped, but people were too busy recording it on their phones. Anyways! ThatÕs a few takeaways IÕve had. Good art always provokes thought and conversation. I love how this video has done that.",0

In addition to obvious gun violence nods, I also find the idea that the people he shoots represent black musical culture (blues, gospel) interesting; shallow hip hop/rap has killed it and replaced with superficial entertainment, which is more or less a distraction from the real issues",0

First reference we get is to Jim Crow era and minstrels, look at the first few dance movements and the pictures found on this link.https://www.google.com/search?client=ms-android-samsung&source=android-home&source=hp&ei=o7jzWpfnGITYwQLSppyABA&q=Jim+Crow&oq=Jim+Crow&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-hp.12..0i131j0i3l2j0l2.556810.559414..560226...1....78.482.8......0....1.......3..35i39j0i67j0i131i67.WD%2Bhoi03850%3D2. Next Glover shooting a mask man is a representation of gun violence and the love of guns and apathy towards the victims (Notice how the firearm is handled carefully but the victim is dragged away). Its also a reference to the Stephon Clark murder by the police. 3. The dancing is to distract the audience from the chaos behind, basically explaining how reality is covered over by dancing.Its also a reference to white peoples love of black culture but apathy and or hatred of black people. 3. The shooting of the choir is a reference to the Charleston church shooting (I think). You'll also hear references to slavery ""Get yo black man"". 4. The white horse is reference to one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse. 5. The chasing of Glover by a white mob is I think a reference to slave catching. Iv probably missed a few things. Also for the purposes of debate I'm white so white supremacists, I'm a race traitor, please address me as such. __",0

Everything in this video has the strongest meaning, and that's where it relates back to reality, every death that occurs is way more important than all this gossip and fake news going around. Basically what this music video is telling us, is that the blurred ""background"" where there is chaos, shouldn't be in the background, and we should be focusing on it rather then prancing around and acting like nothing is wrong. One symbol in this video that was really impactful, yet hard to notice is the fact that he handled the guns like they were royalty, put them on a cloth when he was done shooting, yet the bodies/ body was either left there or dragged away like they had no importance. Over all this was a song/ video that us as a society NEEDED to wake us up from this pretty, fake world we are trying to surround ourselves with.",0

Donald is dancing with the African kids he shoot up some African Americans, then in the end he threatens to shoot the African kids with his fingers but they run. Meanwhile all around there is chaos. I can't seem to find a meaning in this but I will say that I was disturbed and I hope that was the point.

But I think his changing of the melody from upbeat, happy tribal sounding music, to a low guttural, violent sounding beat is brilliant. The former is almost like a representation of how we want to be seen as so called black people. Look at how black panther took the world by storm. Tribal people, by choice, but still intelligent and prosperous by their standards and not the worlds. The latter is how some people view the so called black man's culture. No doubt, due to the state of affairs in Chicago, Detroit, etc. There is reason for that stance. But none the lesser, the facts are true. Black Lives Matter won't touch those topics.Mr. Glover is portraying many Jim crow and post civil war stereotypes in the video, but America is portraying the scene in real time.Peace.",0

Do you know what the poverty rate is for black families that stay together?  It 8%.  That's pretty freaking low.Without a double income, poverty increases.  Without a strong permanent father figure, discipline increases.  How's a mom supposed to discipline her son for fighting in school when she doesn't get home until 10 pm at night?   How is a child pregnant at 16 supposed to learn how to raise a child when her mother had HER at 16 and just passed her on to her grandparent?   Kids learning to whip and concerned with all the latest trends while the white kids are the ones actually trying to inspire change and marching.   Where are the black kids in all this?  Black kids getting killed on the street every day by other blacks, by police, and there's silence.  However, a few white kids get killed at an upper class school and all hell breaks loose for the better part of 3 months! Until 7% of the population stops committing 50% of the murders, there will not be change.   This won't be stopped until parents start being parents and stop being just some random person with a one night stand who forgot or neglected to put on a condom before sticking it in.Change the culture and we can change this nation.

14917,"This is gonna sound so cliche, but when I listen to this, I can picture not only the struggles black people go through here in America, but the struggles of my fellow indigenous people as well as Hispanics and every other minority that struggles everyday here in ""the land of the free.""  In the beginning, the ""go, go away"" can be heard from the perspective of minorities begging to be left alone, but can also be perceived as what minorities are told all the time in America. They put us on Reservations to keep us out of the way, they put African Americans and Hispanics in communities full of poverty and violence, etc. They tell us to leave even though they're the ones who put us in this position; they limit our opportunities in the land of opportunity. And I know a lot of people may respond with some sort of ""that's not true"" comeback, but honestly, until you've been a part of our history and walked in our shoes, you won't understand. Gambino's talking about America in general. I'll never forget how quiet the schoolyard was the morning after Trump won, or how many of my fellow classmates were afraid of their futures. Would they be drafted? Was nuclear war an impending threat? Would women's rights be impeded on? And now, currently, we are still concerned. Will scholarships still be able to pay for our college educations? Will our schools be shot up? Gambino accurately portrays the way people have come to distract themselves from all this: trending dance moves, instagram followers, frivolous, meaningless things we choose to focus on instead of the real problem: gun violence, destruction of the arts, this mass, unsettling fear we have in America. He yells at us to wake the fuck up and start making the changes we desperately need. It's not an over exaggeration, it's the truth. This is America. Anyways, I think it's brilliant and it really speaks to me.",1

At the end every chases him down to kill him because he has exposed the corrucpted cops and the justice system in America.

MichaelÕs death is a conspiracy because he is rumored to be in the process of purchasing a major record label. When an artist look to stir the people they face backlash. When Beyonc did a song referencing Louisiana she faced #boycottbeyonce but when she does songs like Bootylicious thatÕs ok. Anyway this song does have me looking for black artist that inspires they people to greater consciousness CardiB, Jayz, Beyonc, Rhianna, and Drake are great yet....IÕm still playing the Miseducation of Lauren Hill and Michael Jackson when I want to get inspired. Ok artist....yÕall need to get together and bless us with some new albums that go deeper. Thank you.",0

15193,"I have to say that I appreciate the artistry this music video contains.  I've checked it out over and over and have found some of the symbolism shared quite fascinating by Childish Gambino [CG].  And interestingly, I have been looking to see if anyone found him dancing on top of the car...appearing familiar.  For me, It reminded me of MJ.  And I had to go back and check to see if I was remembering it correctly or not.  And in MJ's video Black & White, there was additional content that was performed - which wasn't included in the main video.  Link here for that clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiADkjpyqFIMJ's video was also a social commentary of what was going on then [which is applicable for today as well].   And it was MJ's dancing on the car, that left an indelible image.  The imagery...symbolism leaves one to wonder what is happening?  My speculation is, that car symbolically represents ""progress/moving forward"".  Yet it's parked.  At a standstill and not progressing.  And the decision of dancing on top of that car symbolizes: if the mode of moving forward/progress [parked car] is not moving, might as well be the one moving through art [dance].  And then, as that scene zooms out w CG performing his dance moves.  It takes us into the final scene, where Gambino is for the FIRST TIME no longer smiling...no longer dancing.  He is frightened and running for his life.  It is notable that CG is most frightened NOT after killing a man in the beginning of the video; nor after killing a singing church choir in the middle.  His life is in jeopardy after defiantly expressing his dissatisfaction for the lack of progress by dancing on top of the car.It appears the consequence of CG's ""audacity"" to express himself through art/dance is what ACTUALLY endangers him.  The music video then ends with a scene that is hauntingly similar in lighting of the ""sunken place"" from Get Out.  As the final lyrics express the value - specifically the lack of value - that he has.Once again, I'm impressed w the creativity within this video.  A powerful indelible video that is impossible to only view once!",0

Then again at 2:14 it sounds like the ÒheyÓ Migos has the beginning of their songs. Like in Bad and Boujee the official music video at 0:14 it says ÒheyÓ with almost the same voice in ÒThis Is AmericaÓ. Then finally at 2:36 in this song you can hear Òwalk itÓ like in Migos in ÒWalk it talk itÓ when they sing Òwalk itÓ.

Childish never shoots the kids in school uniforms dancing... How come? Some speculate that he never shoots them because Childish believes that the school shootings were a conspiracy. This is why he uses an imaginary gun at 2:45. 3.) The joint that Childish pulls out at 2:58 was rolled by a white man... this is known due to the shape of the joint and the clear struggle to roll this joint. 4.) Childish at 2:55 wakes up an remembers that even though America has many problems and is messed up in many ways... we still aren't North Korea.. he celebrates by smoking the joint he keeps between his butt cheeks. 5.) There are 4 random white people that will appear at different points in this video... see if you can spot them.

I would add it is just not about the violence towards African Americans it about a deeper story being told about the culture and morals of all Americans- black, white and every race in this country. ItÕs easy to ignore when we hear about isolated incidences in America that occur on a regular basis. This isnÕt normal but weÕre not shocked until its plastered before our eyes as this video has done, then we say this is disturbing to watch. America has dismissed morality for indecency and moral decay. Guns have replaced civil confrontation and communication. Ignorance has replaced reasonable thought. Music and entertainment has been replaced with vulgarity. Hard work has been replaced with idleness and homelessness. Coping with life has been replaced with opioid dependency. The rising cost of education is and will continue to be out of reach for future Americans. The dogmatic actions taken by legislators to deny Americans healthcare are immoral. The inability of America to make our roads, highways, schools and all infrastructure projects be upgraded for the next century is impossible because money outweighs the needs for a safer and growing America. If we really understood that the tax burden placed on the working poor is untenable, and demand funding comes from those of privilege we could solve a lot of problems and have that better America. So these are the failures of America and this video shouldnÕt shock anyone.  America is not this great country when we really take a close look. The sad part is I barely scratched the surface pointing out what in reality, America is! We shouldnÕt overlook the corrosiveness in Washington, DC, Congress, Supreme Court, and the willful abuse and insults on the Constitution of this nation. ItÕs so sickening now, there is an element in America that donÕt have a problem with the way things are. The minute something is said about the outcomes in America, folks either retreat to tribalism, partisan politics, racism, nationalism or some other ridiculous stance. Most have forgotten how to walk in the footsteps of others or feel the pain and suffering of fellow Americans. The blind keep telling us Iran and North Korea are out to get us! People, weÕre out to get us! The divisiveness in this country is what is harming us. ItÕs Americans that are the threat to fellow Americans. Why canÕt folks see a divided nation will crumble onto itself? This is my interpretation of the video, ÒThis is America.Ó Thanks for listening.",0

Anonymous children videoing the whole thing, symbolizing the new role social media is taking in political activism. Death on a plane horse in the background.CG shot from the waist up, hands empty but held like he's armed (the way a cop would see him), then lighting a joint.

In the background white men Running after blacks and people going crazy and dying . When the camera points up it shows a bunch of people not doin anything but recording it . Showing the present America today . Also thereÕs a white horse with a shadow figure on it (represents Death) walks into the church calmy then begins to shoot everyone.once again the gun is carried away better then the people . (Church shooting that happened). Once again he chrildren are dancing while bare chaos is happening End: smokes the blunt basically showing he has the whole world in a blunt or all we do is smoke everywhere away. Sza was suppose to represent the Statue of Liberty but no one really saw her . Turns black and shows him running from police and white Folks. Showing that in the end how scared we are for our lives and that we live in fear of the white manJus my perspective ______",0

J.cole, Kendrick Lamar, childish gambino they all are humans they make mistakes as well as us but what happens around them they can't just stand a watch they will do something about it. they realize that the generation of today and the future gen will surfer. yes it's talking about america but there's more to this song. now you've got Brazilians, Mexicans, and many more speaking of this song . but what more terrifying is just take a closer look at the background. ignore childish gambino and the children dancing take a look at how the gun is being handled with care instead of the bodies being killed. take a look at the bystanders looking from above while they are on their phone bruh take a look at the kid blowing money while he's still in high school take a look at the guy who feel off the building. all of these thing but yet that's not what this generation cares about. i will say it again, america is a bad place to live and america is all about BUSINESS!! ""we just wanna party, party just for you. we just want the MONEY,  MONEY just FOR YOU!!"" what is that, really what is that saying. a lot of hidden messages A LOT and one last thing for anyone WHO READS THE BIBLE; will see a PALE horse and death riding it. were is that from REVALUATIONS here it says, And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. in conclusion, AMERICA IS A SCARY COUNTRY TO LIVE IN. it's not even a country its a business",0

15727,"I think its what's wrong with the world not just America, we see countless atrocities everyday to the point where we have become numb to them, remember live aid in the 1980s we had no idea of how horrible the situation was so we got together to help......for a while and then we went back to what we were doing. Now we see it every minute of everyday and some of us see red and want to do something but what? There's something at play in the world, things are getting more and more out of balance to the point where when they lead us to slaughter we will just line up no questions asked, were being molded and controlled little by little each day. However I think humans yes including me are the dumbest species on the planet, its only until the water is at neck height that we say to ourselves heck we should have built that boat back a few years ago before the flood came. We get together and march when we see evil but we cant stop it because our voices eventually fall silent, if you want change to come you have to keep the message alive, for instance if you speak up about countless innocent children being killed while at their schools don't just have a few mass walkouts make it once a week or fortnight until change has happened what can they do expel every student? Maybe Im not the best voice to be heard but stop listening all together to the wrong ones, we've gone to listening to true leaders in our communities and countries to putting our faith in Pop stars and athletes they are not the ones that make a difference you are and when several voices are heard all at the same time and they push for change in a peaceful way well then thats when things do change forever and not just for 5 minutes.",0

Its About time an artist pointed out that ""this is America"" not Rwanda in the 90s but the murders continue in places like Chicago despite the fact that the community was Organized so well by Obama and i do thinks its appropriate that the only people making an attempt to stop the mass killing are chasing you in the end. 10/10 for telling it like it is Childish Gambino,",0

16104,"1. To really understand the video, you actually have to force yourself to look at everything else while Gambino & others start dancing. Watch it first for fun then rewatch it without the dancing. 2. The Rwandan actress/choreographer/ Afrobeat star Sherrie Silver was apart of and in charge of the choreography which mixed both African and African American styles of dancing. 1:36 3. The Jim Crow caricature which not only symbolizes the Jim Crow law, but the black face minstrels that birthed out of that character of Jim Crow literally killing the authenticity of black people through music.0:51 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_(character)4. The Charleston / ongoing mass shootings in supposedly Òsafe areasÓ (churches schools etc) 5. Notice how everytime he shot someone the gun was handled with care/ covered with a piece of cloth. In my own opinion... I believe it symbolizes the protection guns have through the gun laws. The U.S values the safety of literal guns over their own people.",0

But then when I actually thought about whats going on, it is Gambino, a black man and the artist who shoots the choir, who is singing about ""get your money"" as if it was a mandate from god. I think in part the artist is saying that kind of thinking needs to be stopped, as it will lead to death (death being unhappiness, the sunken place, or lack of real success... or actual death). I think this thought is reinforced by the guy jumping off the balcony, as he seems to be the only person wearing a shirt and tie in the whole video (It's a quick clip and in the bg, so granted, i may not be seeing it right)",0

You wanna see change ? encourage your followers not only to vote but to invest in their own communities an demand to be heard. convince our brothers and sisters and younger children that education is important and don't let no Society take that from you . unfortunately, everybody and they mama is waiting on Kanye and Childish Gambino to formulate their opinion for them. these folk don't care about us because they're rich and getting richer exploiting our tragedies. don't be fooled people only time they care about something is when they want to sell you something.

16362,"A few things I noticed: The shooting of the choir seemed like an allusion to the Dylan Roof shooting. He placed himself as the shooter in two different situations, kids came for the bodies and police with batons shortly after. Initially I didnÕt notice the kids and saw the police and thought maybe heÕs making a statement on police brutality, as in the victims are often viewed as the perpetrators. But aside from this the whole video seems like a call to the black community to bring order from amongst all the chaos because the most affected by it are young black youths. It was interesting how he gave his first gun to a young boy, I think heÕs pinpointing a problem of mentor ship here, because where do we think these young kids are getting guns in the ghetto? Older men who should be leading them down the straight and narrow. Also the camera focuses on the youth and gambino more. Showing the effects of the chaos on youth but also on youth indifference to social issues, if anything they are more in-tuned with social media, distracted from whatÕs going on all around them. But I also believe he means to send a message to all of America, hence the title, but he doesnÕt shy away from pointing out fatal inconsistencies in the black community. The list goes on but those were standout points to me. Very interesting for this piece to come out shortly after J Coles album and his KOD acronym. I see similarities in their message and itÕs pretty encouraging to see rappers getting a message across through various art forms.",0

With a lack  of morals or desperation, getting by often means violence for income and gangs as support groups. Over the past 30 or so years this cycle has continued over and over but why haven't we learned from our mistakes yet? Because like Kanye said, we are choosing to perpetuate the mental slavery we're in. Slavery was abolished in the 1700's but only in the literal sense. Mental slavery is still legal and is used on a daily basis. You're more than just a moneymaking mule for the rich, break the cycle and break the chains, it IS possible if you really want to get out. And once you're out take a good hard look at you're ex captors. Study them, observe their patterns and use this knowledge to help your neighbor.",0

16509,"Childish Gambino's ""This Is America"" he plays a Jim Crow caricature that shows plenty of symbolism through subtle nuances & direct distractions by entertaining through dance & trap lyricism. Trendy dancing & the glorification of materialism, while chaos, violence & death takes place around him and in our direct viewing. Desensitized as if the violence is non-existent or just a normal aspect of our daily lives. The last part of the video is mirroring how black ancestors attempted to escape chaos & death from former slave masters. Running through the darkness, with no real place to run to. #Extras Peep SZA on the hood of the car. The car scene depicts OldsmobileÕs - take note that Philando Castile was killed by police in a 1997 Oldsmobile. I believe the killing of the choir was in reference of the mass shooting in Charleston SC by Dylann Roof....",0

However, there's one I haven't seen in the comments; the common saying is that ignorance is bliss and throughout the majority of the vid, apart from the evil actions through performing executions, he is dancing, jovial and care free. Until towards the end when he takes a toke from the smoke (enter drug name here) the chaos ends and the music lightens up. Reflective of being high? blocking out the world and your own problems. That is until the next frame places you through a tunnel of darkness, perhaps on the other side of the highÊand displays him being chased. My conclusionÊof the last scene alone, is that ignoring the chaos around you is fine until one day it knocks on your very own door. It's a call to humanity to stopÊignoring what's around youÊand unite as a people to fight against the darkness together. As you can see, the fight against darkness isn't always physical. Education the people using the very tools they use against us works just as well. Just my thoughts",0

Every frame has a message to convey.My takeaway is that hard work, perseverance, talent and creativity  are  bulletproof. In the opening sequence we see a guitarist. The guitarist is shot and killed. However, towards the end, we see him alive ( though with a bag on his head) showing mastery of his instrument. Being ""killed"" is tantamount to society telling you you will never make it, or going to your umpteenth job interview  (yours truly) and hearing "" we still have other candidates to interview"" Yes, blacks are profiled, discriminiated against and maligned, but that's not an excuse to give up.",0

DonÕt get me wrong IÕm not whining. But just think of what place should the american idols have. Personally I heard enough to know they are not changing anything. We keep shocking more and more as long as mankind Ç evolves È but we end up having a more and more violent and divided society. Maybe we should start keeping quiet about all this and talk about the silent heroes to help the youth to find hope and inspiration. The ones who go live in countries where they risk their lives to make a difference instead. There is no black people no white people no sexism no minorities. The fact is we are a majority exploited by a minority. The rest is simply a smokescreen.",0

Chaos ensues as people riot and drag away the bodies, but ignore Gambino and his backup dancers completely. Gambino's reckless acts catch up with him by the end though, when we see him being chased through the now darkened warehouse. I think through this video and song Donald Glover tries to illuminate the ways in which the celebrity-like and hedonist lifestyle symbolically kill the spirit and tradition of black art and black community and spirituality by glamorizing violence. Today's mainstream artists use this spirit as a means to an end, just as Gambino first kills the tradition, using it as a mere sample in this elegy to meaningfulness.",0

17220,"Wow. This video brings a whole new light on issues within America and how much further we must come as a country. He starts the video with a man who seems content and then starts dancing to the simple nice melody. Quickly that peacefulness disappears as Glover shoots a man in the head and things seem to quickly go to chaos. I think the conflict Donald is trying to get at is gun violence. ItÕs clear heÕs showing how everything is nice and peaceful until abruptly a tragedy happens with a gun. HeÕs trying to show that when tragedyÕs like Parkland or Las Vegas happen, no one knows that itÕs going to happen until it does. This repeats itself when a somewhat similar scene happens. As soon as the melody and beat turns back to what would be considered trap, he once again starts shooting at a choir, most likely pointing to the church shooting in Charleston South Carolina a year and a half ago. One of the most powerful moves that Donald chose to make was having very limited cuts within the video. Having a continual video without cutting to different scenes makes the video much more appealing and powerful. It creates a connection between the two grim scenes, leading the viewer to believe that violent events with guns are triggered and thought of because of other violent events.  One thing that IÕm very curious about, because there wasnÕt very much reasoning or emphasis on them is the background dancers. TheyÕre all black teens dressed in what looked to be school outfits. IÕm unsure the message heÕs trying to point to because typically school shootings are in public schools, but it brings nice transitions from the main scenes. In the closing seconds of the film, Glover is running from others who appear to be white. I think this scene is leaving the viewer with the idea that black people have been running from white people for centuries, and how systematic oppression is still very prevalent in todayÕs world. He reinforces this idea with the lyrics in the background, ÒYou just a Black man in this world, you just a barcode, ayyÓ. Overall this video was very impactful, depicting gruesome scenes that are commonly shielded from viewers and showing scenery that are all to common in America.",0

Gambino shoots him in that ""Jim Crow"" pose, implying that stereotypes took everything away from black culture, killed it and replaced it with their own caricature. Near the end of the video the man is shown again with his guitar but still with a mask on, implying that society appreciates and glorifies the music but fails to recognize the people behind it. This video is fascinating.",0

At the end of this video, when Gambino was running away from people in the background, it symbolizes how we try to run away from our problems. Gambino also shows how the guns that he uses to shoot the people are treated better than the human lives in it.

17714,"HOLY SHIT, just notice another hidden meaning. Donald actually makes 3 massive statements about guns in this video, two which were very obvious because it used guns we could see visually. The 3rd is so subtle that it took me a bunch of re-watches to start understanding. The 3rd gun statement happens when he raises his arms and says pow but has nothing in his hands. Could this be symbolism for unarmed black killings? Or is he saying that as a black/minority artist one would be portrayed and misinterpreted as somebody whos promoting gun violence? For speaking out? I mean this reminds me back when M.I.A's Paper Plane video was actually censored in some parts of Europe for having the sound of gunshots in the background and her saying pow pow pow in the video ? IS he saying that when an black artist has something to say about things that matter, the media would sensationalize it and twist it around? Note that he doesn't mention guns in his song and the only time he says anything about it is ""pow"" (plus the physical gesture of it) yet people overreact and flee in terror when they should have been doing that for the first two guns. It kinda makes sense why he had that fed up look afterward and pulled out a blunt.  Felt like be broke the 4th wall there.",0

Well, maybe my parents had some responsibility until I was 18 but hell, I was not listening to them after I turned 10-13.  Sad but true. I HAD four brothers so we struggled for money.  I love my dad who is gone now.  I love my mom, who better not leave soon for my sanity sake.  Love your neighbor and quit the blame game.  It is simply people trying to control your mind.  Nobody, absolutely nobody should have control over how you feel.  Live your life for yourselves and the people you love.  It is not that hard to do.  This video is hate speach.

18051,"I'm quickly becoming a fan of Donald Glover. I'm doing my best to try and understand a generation at least 40 years apart from me. I'll start by admitting that it took me a while before watching an episode of Atlanta. Thought it was going to be all flash, bling or hit you over the head with social injustice in a preachy talk down way. But I was VERY wrong. The writing was incredible. Creative, fresh and intelligent. So I'm a fan of Atlanta now. Reminds me of some of the John Singleton films. I can't really identify with the characters but I can appreciate the Art of the story telling and film making skill.  As for the video sure is a lot going on. The most obvious statements about gun violence, police and the injustices felt by many in the black community across the country. Me I'm old enough to have been around when Martin Luther King was killed while fighting for equality and a peaceful end to social injustice. I thought that we had come such a long way here in America. It saddens me that we have become so polarized. I consider myself progressive thinking when it comes to race relations. I also support police. I've broken bread with black families and shared a few drinks with good cops. I'd hate to think that the future is nothing but doom ending in destruction like some apocalypse,",0

He stops and thinks about it for a second then pulls out the joint (another distraction) and moves on.

18099,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Childish Gambino. The images are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of cinematic language  most of the messages will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Donald Glover's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his production- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these messages, to realize that they're not just meaningful- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Childish Gambino truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the philosophical message in Childish Gambino's existential catchphrase ""This is America,"" which itself is a cryptic take down of Donald Trump. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Donald Glover's genius wit unfolds itself on their screens. What fools.. how I pity them. __And yes, by the way, i DO have a Childish Gambino Tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid __",0
18100,"Donald Glover left the ending of this video up for interpretation by the viewers. I view the ending as this, people always accuse white people for stealing Black Culture.

18236,The lyrics are just important as the video. You can think for yourself and not have to believe what people tell you to believe. The song literally tells you what it is about. He shoots the barefoot gentleman that is displaying a musical talent showing you that now rap and everything else he says in his lyrics has killed the beautiful music of the islands and the more primitive roots of black musical culture. He is straight up saying that all we want is for him to dance and sing like a puppet while the real struggle literally occurs in the background. He is a saying that the black men we care about are products (barcode) to entertain America. He states that those in black America that are consuming black artists as a product are worried about obtaining the lifestyle that they perpetuate. People always trying to be deep when the point is on the surface. Read the lyrics while watching. The man is telling you how he feels and everybody wants to tell him what he means.,0

18242,"When you see the image of a man with a guitar, like a hooded unknown artist, he is going through a creative time portal. In both images either seeing himself in one body' and also inside another body. The possibility that the twin ray portal has it's place and it's meaning thereby, if this is truth, and one can drift into either stream's...and one can drift into portal position's of outer conscious and inner conscious...via' flying through eitherÊidiom; ideally. Wherein idea's and dreams flow--freely in the creative--zones. Sometimes' when I see this nor do I profess we could by seeingÊthat in someÊimage metaphor'Êsampling example, get the gist of it, rightly; myself I will take the violent--side's in the shot's sequence--the idea is laden that in videoÊmessage' you should not end up, doing things... to destroy that' side of your creative self.ÊThereby via running in the end you're running away from your best self? And your seeing whatever via image noting,Êor the bottom lining, drumbeat. Do not do the thing's that could possibly or later on, end up coming across, in a brutal outcomes via any kinds of ""bad forms in energy."" Do not let out the side that will somehow....later on, let the bad anything form's of energy....destroy that which is the good' deep within inside of you? Yes. Michael Gering has a way to interpret it ""that way"" it's telling you not to do that stuff? Maybe, the message gets lost from the violence, but maybe the reason was for that as in what is being transferred is the ease to go from the higher conscious good things, ideally morphed by circumstances, soÊeasily to fall' into the negative energy, if you cannot corral controlling your mind over matters + circumstances to be coral led into doing bad thing's. Gathering the images in one viewing ""I got some of that out of it overall"" but if you take in meaning in the other ways possible you could see how the stream was not followed right. Surely you have to move outside to second sight to get where the artist was intent to go2. Yeah Brother. In all this Mike G. say's ""you going deep"". Êwww.MichaelGering.weebly.com",0

18421,"Everything I noticed + Ad-Libs2:13 someone commits suicide in the back (people are distracting by dancing, etc.)Just before he shoots the choir, he dances to their music. I took that as a nod to cultural appropriation, where people will take the bits of black culture they find amusing and exploit it but donÕt give it its due credit or appreciation. Then, when he tires of the choir, thatÕs when he shoots them. HeÕs used them for what he can get from them, then just as quickly, and with complete disregard for their humanity, he dismisses them. I also felt that he highlighted how easy it is to get ahold of a gun in our country. He simply held out his hands to shoot the choir and was handed one.I think itÕs also representative of the value of black bodies. The dancing and entertaining is at the forefront of the video while violence wages on in the background and can be easily missed. So in essence, weÕre only valued when weÕre making music, dancing, and entertaining (White) America, something that can be capitalized. In the background, you can hear Òblack man, make that moneyÓ. But the real stuff: long term effects of poverty and marginalization, policy brutality, racism, inner city violence, suicide, etc. are ignored.When he shoots in the beginning he is making the Jim Crow stanceThere was a group of people watching on their phones representing most Americans(some of this stuff I only noticed after being pointed out online)Ad libs:0:36/2:01/3:01/3:42 - Young Thug1:08 - Kendrick1:20/1:36/2:42 - BlocBoy1:21 - Big Sean1:26 - Rick Ross1:39/2:20/2:32 - 21 Savage1:40 - Lil pump2:06 - Slim Jxmmi2:14 - Offset2:25/2:30/2:44 - Quavo 3:08 - Amin",0

Finally it alludes to the war on drugs in America and how law enforcers seem to target young black men who smoke weed as if it's more harmful than murder.",0

Police brutality is a problem in our community but I feel itÕs not everyoneÕs problem. A lot of us leave in nice places where things like this really wouldnÕt happen and if it ever did itÕs kept deeply hidden because some communities try and advance inclusiveness. But while those young people are dancing and think they are finally apart of America, you can see him gradually continue to get crazier as he sees that he can get away with these things.

18969,"People miss the bigger picture depicted in the video and song that's not about gun violence, police brutality, nor even race. At the end of the video, after the show is over, ALL types of people that were a part of this show are running for their lives in the dark, not just blacks. What people aren't understanding is ALL the things happening through most of the video, background included, are a part of the show... at least until their usefulness is up and then are either done away with violently like the bluesman/choir, quietly like those that know and run away in fear (and disappear for good) when Gambino freezes midway through, or co-opted into something else useful for the show. Near the end of the video Gambino dances on top of car in a defiant macho way... but... ultimately this is all just part of the show. This defiant attitude has been co-opted into something else to sell, like the cars we saw earlier in the riot. To use as part of the show... all under the eye of foreman's office.Maybe this will help put it in perspective for you. Read the lyrics of the song as not from the point of view of Gambino but from someone telling him who he has to be as an entertainer. The lyrics go from one media depiction of stereotypical black culture to another. Some of the lyrics that end the song really drive home the underlying meaning: ""You're just a barcode. Drivin' expensive foreigns. You just a big dawg. Kenneled in the backyard."" Just a barcode. Just a dog, a pet. For who?? ... Throughout the song Gambino is being TOLD that ""THIS is America"" for the modern black man and that he better not be caught slipping up in carrying on this facade.Think about the metaphorical significance of the setting for the video being a giant whitewashed warehouse. Why a warehouse? If you watch closely you will see people working to keep the show going in the background and on the edges of frame throughout, as well as many subtle signs/props revealing it's all a big fakery. These things don't have to be put in these carefully planned-out shots yet... they are. Hmm... Actors used later in the show carry away dead bodies and used props (such as guns) and scurry away or take on another role for the shot. Crew members are clearly seen running straight through the set several times (like 1:15) when they would not have to be to make the shot happen. They are deliberately included. Despite the ""riot"" going on, we glimpse actors not currently active just chilling above filming the show on their phones (2:25). There are many instances throughout like at 3:33: On the right edge of the frame, along with a broom that could very easily not be in the shot, a crew member waits with water bottles for the show to be over. He could easily be closer to the wall and out of frame.Gambino is frozen three times in the video: At the beginning in a neutral pose. Later in a shooting pose. And finally, as the show ends, in a rock-and-roll pose. Let that sink in.And we're left with Gambino running in terror, along with many others (notice they're running WITH him not after), as the barcode/dog lyrics mentioned earlier play out.",0

19019,"One of the clearest examples of how blacks and or are mistreated compared to whites in this country is the opioid/heroine epidemic. In the 1980s-1990s the ""war on drugs"" was put into place to not help but incarcerate any person found using or selling crack cocaine in inner city communities. Now today white middle class Americans are addicted to opioids/heroine and no one is being locked up. Middle class white Americans are literally selling and distributing heroine to pay for their habit and nothing is being done to them no prison time not anything. They're actually rehabilitating people to try and help them and give them a second chance. And you might ask why this is so, because no one cares if something happens to black people but as soon as white people are effected all hell breaks lose. The attorney general was asked about this and he said and I quote ""This is the country we live in"" think about that, the ATTORNEY FUCKING GENERAL. You're obviously living in a bubble if you don't see the problems going on in this country and the mistreatment of black and brown people.",0

So, to laugh off someone, who is exposing the uncomfortable truth,  is a very common yet effective way to ignore that truth - which leads to the untreated, deepening insanity.From the perspective of a healthy mind, America is insane.

People died for our freedoms and I can guarantee that Ive enjoyed the status of a free man all of my life. I was not born a house nigger, I am and I'll say it again, a FREE MAN. I've never been a victim because I don't willingly put on shackles given to me by the people that claim they know what's best for me and my people. I would really like for you to think about that. Im enjoying the freedoms that my ancestors gave to me because in my opinion, it is the best way to honor them, to expand our horizons as a people. It breaks my heart to see so many people continue to stare at the shadows dancing on the cave wall, never realizing or even wanting to know that there is a whole world behind them if they only took off the chains and turned around to see the light of the fire.Any of us that see the world for what it is and only want to help our brothers and sisters see the truth are immediately outcasted and rejected by our own people because we only want them to succeed in fully realizing the freedoms that our ancestors died to give us. The best slave is one that willingly wears the shackles of his oppressors while thanking them. I can only hope that with recent events, the tides turn and we can finally make our ancestors proud instead of killing each other and tearing each other down for our own benefit in this vicious cycle, it's been going on for too long. The people that truly think of us like animals are the same ones that try to promote this glamorous gangster culture as if it's the benchmark for all of our children and I can tell you they aren't the conservative white men in this country. They enact policies that mentally cripple us, telling us that we can't fend for ourselves and need their help, teach our kids from such an early age that they are slaves, that we should be hateful. Forcing us to adhere to a victim mentality all of our life until it's become so second nature that most never question the fact that they willingly let themselves be chained down by these very ideas.",0

19959,"Donald brings a nice message to the table with his lyricism and the video definitely added a lot onto it, but musicians are the ones profiting off of it and really the problems they speak of donÕt effect them at all. They like to talk and condemn these instances but usually they donÕt really care; for them itÕs a trigger topic that is guaranteed to make money and revenue. Unless Donald is going out to projects and trying to benefit the communities heÕs speaking out against, then IÕm not really impressed. Yes, heÕs bringing attention to the issue, but a massive amount of rap, historically, has already covered the problems he brings up. He just put it into a neat, aesthetically pleasing package. and he likes to speak on the issues of black culture in the video but if memory serves me correctly, he grew up middle/lower middle class and has been living comfortably for most of his life, so it seems hypocritical and ungenuine coming from him. All, (or nearly all) of the imagery is completely clear cut and obvious, youÕd be retarded to not understand the ÒdeepÓ symbolism. I want to shit on him for making the imagery so extremely obvious but itÕs mainstream music and a lot of dumbasses are consumers of that genre, so, I understand his brunt approach. all in all IÕd give ÒThis is AmericaÓ a 5/10. Other rappers have conveyed the same ideas with better lyrics and sound composition overall.",1

20187,"It kinda feels like he's commenting on the rappers of the modern day. Like the guns and the line ""I got the stap"" could show how they are flaunted and encouraged in the rapper world which could lead to increased numbers of gun violence and also when he said ""hunnid bands"" x3 it could show how rappers only flaunt their wealth and money and that's all they do so like the repitition could show how they repeat the same stuff on wealth and money. Also the part where he says ""Im so dope like yeah"" it could show how all rappers think they are the best and keep talking about how awesome they are. Also at 2:19 he says ""Im on gucci"" which doesnt really follow Donald's normal song flow. He doesnt usually flex so that seems out of the normal UNLESS he was mocking how rappers flaunt and worship Gucci and so many songs include them wearing Gucci clothes. Also what fuels this theory the most for me are the call outs like how at 1:39 after his dialogue I swear to god you can hear ""esketit"" in the background. If that's not a direct call out then idk what is. Also at 2:30 He says ""On my Kodak"" and in the background you hear an adlib of ""Black"" which is Kodak Black...a rapper who falls into this category of flexing rappers. Anyway, that's what I make of all of this tho. You could think he's commenting on gun violence and stuff which makes more sense and is more relevant but like it just feels too convinient that all of this stuff is also there in the video...",0

We has humanity has set a bad way about how everyone sees everyone and it won't change until we put down and metaphoric weapons and hand in hand surrender our wrongs and live and respect everyone as one then and only then we will has a better world for everyone and the generations to come will understand we are equal no matter what's been done In the past as what we do now alters the present",0

A cell phone can be used as a tool in favor of victims of police brutality because they are used to record evidence. Celly can also mean jail cell used as a tool to oppress black men.

I mean it, listen to this with the idea of it parodying a popular pop or maybe rap song and its seems like (to me, at least) that its criticising artists that, on one hand are seen as almost ""wholesome"" (charities, empowerment, that sort of thing) yet on the same hand glamorizes violence all while sort of saying ""this is how it is in America.""The start with a sort of light hearted party song, dropping into violence immediately followed by some shiny wholesome dancing with kids (school kids, no less). The fact that a good portion of the people in the background are wearing what seems like school uniforms might be in reference to how kids are usually the audience, to the point that school orginizations pump that shit out on blast.Dancing while people are frantic, running, having music where, frankly, the theme could pretty much be summed up with ""black man get your money""Idk, but maybe thia is criticizing all those celebreties, and those who admire them, that are 100% pro gun control, pro minority empowerment, yet 50 seconds ago where talking about how they deal in human trafficking, shooting people, and taking drugs.I really want to know what other people think. Am I wrong? Or maybe, misguided?",1

20537,"Gambino chooses the Jim Crow pose at the onset for the first shooting. And in case you're unaware of Jim Crow, it was the practice of segregating black people in the US. I personally believe it still exists, but it's just more strategic. The fact that most people don't recognize the pose is important. Forgetting our history or attempting to cover it up is why Black and White Americans are still living such disparate lives. This is America. Certain people kill people in public places, schools, churches, etc. and walk away free... taken into custody, peacefully mind you, and are defended by a justice system that benefits them. Other certain people light a blunt and have to outrun the police or are taken violently into custody or killed. There are African Americans still serving jail sentences for marijuana possession/sales, while an entire industry has sprung up that is making certain states millions of dollars. Black man, get out and get your money. This is America. Murder, incarceration, inequality, injustice, cultural appropriation, distraction... Don't think about the issues. Just dance and look pretty.

So many of us brandish the negative image all day and then turn around and get mad at someone for believing we are the image we portray and then we all of a sudden want to be these sweet people who did no wrong. Then those of us who don't want no parts of the BS get caught up in it. Ultimately rappers who talk about killing each other all day wouldn't be as big as they are if people weren't buying their music and since the positive rappers don't get any support(except the few who make it) then most upcoming rappers are encouraged to continue on this poison. At the end of the day you have to pay bills and making music costs a lot of money, so the average artist is going to go where the money is.",0

And it's mostly poor white people in areas where the jobs are all but gone. Black people is who the elites want gone. After slavery they wanted to send them all back to Africa but that didn't work-they did get many to leave and they left and formed Liberia. They also enacted laws to get black people arrested in large numbers. Just read the 14th Amendment with the wording, ""EXCEPT,"" to get the understanding. Then they got the women through sterilization from the Eugenics campaign they ran. This worked. Many black women and some poor whites were sterilize. They were referred to as, ""Feeble minded."" The Eugenics campaign eventually became abortion and a ""woman's rights to choose""-black women who are only 6% of the US population perform the most abortions of any racial group. The government also dumped drugs and guns in black neighborhoods and lo and behold, that also worked. It's still working today. The elites in America DO NOT WANT BLACK PEOPLE IN AMERICA. Black people in America will NEVER be equal to the white man. The day you all realize that, is the day you will understand your place in America and play shrewd. Singing a song about it does NOTHING. You need ACTION. Quit playing like boys in a field.

20969,"The warehouse is America itself. The man in the beginning, (symbolizing native Americans and America before Columbus and the western worldÕs interference) is given a guitar representing freedom and the American Dream. Explorers and settlers came to America because of their attraction to the American Dream (freedom and new opportunities) The camera takes the man and the guitar out of frame and instead starts focusing on Glover, showing that time has past and America was more focused on other things (this is when he first mentions money after only mentioning partying). When the guy comes back into frame he is shown with a bag over his head. Hes shot and with the death of the American Dream comes modernization and contemporary ideals. The beat drops and becomes more familiar than the rhythmic percussion and chants from before. The man disappears for the better part of the music video only to return when Glover is on top of the car with SZA close by. HeÕs now seen with both the guitar and the bag over his head. The American Dream is back but is not the same as before. HeÕs trying to play guitar like before and be joyous and free-spirited but he canÕt see whatÕs around him and doesnÕt know if heÕll be shot again. HeÕs being held hostage and is performing his own type of dance in order to stay alive. HeÕs now playing in conjunction with the idea of money(Òget your money, Black manÓ repeated as soon as he returns into frame). The American Dream is no longer synonymous with freedom and having fun and partying, but rather with money and wealth and the entire culture we have right now with excessive ÒflexingÓ. It doesnÕt matter what we actually feel as long as we convince others that weÕre well off.And then the warehouse becomes dark and instead of seeing America through the eyes of the early white immigrants and their offspring, we are seeing America through the eyes of black America and minority America. Instead of everything appearing bright and easy, it becomes dark and it terrifies us. We now understand why people were robbing cars and jumping off the second floor of the warehouse. America becomes scary and youÕre trying to find a way out.",0

Bad things have been happening since the beginning of time, and just because itÕs more televised people think the world is ending, although when you look at the statistics, right now crime rate is at its lowest in 10 years, and millions of new jobs have been created by Trump. We live in the greatest country in the world. IÕm not saying things arenÕt wrong, but what isnÕt wrong with this world? Why donÕt we stop focusing on the country with the smallest amount of issues, and letÕs actually save countries and nations like Africa, Saudi Arabia, North Korea...why donÕt we worry about them? Instead we worry about the country where a few people die, while millions are dying on the other side of the world. Why donÕt we worry about pollution and think ahead instead of worrying about ourselves? Childish Gambino could give 2 shits about whatÕs happening right now, heÕs rich and successful, he doesnÕt experience discrimination, heÕs not broke, he hasnÕt been to jail...he has nothing to worry about. This message is hollow and overused. LetÕs worry about the real problems before we worry about our spoiled lives",0

Who exactly is this video for?? The issues being brought up aren't anything new or revolutionary. Plenty of other rappers have made much more profound and vivid music and music videos that touch on the subjects he's bringing up. I just don't see what's so great about this. Black people know about these issues and fight them everyday. I just don't feel this should be getting near the praise it gets. And the lyrics are pretty below average.

The whole warehouse is a manifestation of his psyche. The chaos around him is the head space that the media tries to keep us in.

21489,"If any of the gun lovers and racists see this video it will only reinforce their own views about gun haters and blacks.  I am really disheartened about the future of America because republicans don't value life at all.  They talk the talk but they don't walk the walk.  If you value life you want to get rid of guns.  Even if only one life was be saved by banning guns that would be enough if you really were pro life.  But they aren't.  If you're black and you dare to complain that things aren't perfect then you're the problem.  They don't care about your problems and begrudge you for thinking your problems are valid, while they go and vote for Trump because they think he will solve their problems.  These guys think that blacks should be happy with whatever scraps we toss at them and if they aren't then their the problem.  People are so busy trying to see our differences that they overlook our similarities because most of us have the same problems, liberals just don't think being more of an asshole is the way to solve them.  But if you portray the US as some crime riddled place people won't listen to you because it isn't.  I like the song but I'm not sure how I feel about the video.  I don't think it's shocking enough to be shocking and I don't think it adds much to the conversation about race and gun violence.  IMO if you want to us art to make political messages it needs to be held to a higher standard.  No disrespect intended.",1

21495,"(Before you read this does not pertain to the gun violence aspect of the video) I appreciate people trying to convey there opinions and emotions but unfortunately I find this videoÕs use of extreme imagery and race-baiting to be stretch for a higher level of fame and money rather than a message of importance. I see little evidence in todayÕs society that any true level of racism exist in America, if you would like a second opinion google some Lil Wayne interviews, and you can hear him talk about how he has never experienced or witnessed racism throughout his entire life. When you see Donald go into the ÒJim crowÓ pose to shoot his first victim this is an obvious reference oppression and segregation which hasnÕt exist in any form for over 50 years (1965 to be exact) or how at the end you can see him being chased by a crowd of white people as an allusion to trying to escape the bondage of slavery which hasnÕt existed since 1865! Unless you see this video in different way, in which a black man runs around shooting other black people and then at the end he is being chased for his crimes _____ Sorry if this comment makes you mad but to me this seems like a tasteless money grab",1

21499,"Either everyone is overthinking or underthinking the purpose of this video. Its obvious its not meant to top charts in performance or sound, but serves more of a purpose explaining the biggest problems with americans and the way we act and think. I believe Gambino is utilizing his own way to express these situations into art/music, as well as making fun of rappers who claim to have the ears of the youth when in reality its all loud garbage autotuned to ""sound"" great, but not actually have any lyrical sense in them. Glad someone found a way to show how they really feel about America, and not just say ""Yeah fuck everyone else, because we have freedom in america"" kind of thinkng.",1

21510,"Nossa... Vi e revi isso umas sei l quantas vezes. Tem uns delrio meu aqui... Mas vou falar. Tenho visto algumas anlises e na maioria observei o pessoal muito preso ao clipe apenas. Cara, vendo a Clipe e vendo a traduo (com seus possveis erros) tem umas coisas que tem muito a ver. No inicio a msica tem um ritmo me parece Africano, mas com uma letra americanizada, isso bem na hora do tio Ruckus. Nessa parte a letra se concentra em queremos festa, dinheiro, garota voc me faz danar. Cara, isso lembra os rits americanos, inclusive de cantores negros... Pensei em Kanye Weste, que inclusive certa vez fez uma declarao ""espatafrdia"" dizendo que escravido foi opo (algo assim), sem contar que sua esposa  Kim Kardashian, o puro espetculo de mdia em pessoa que faz reality show da  prpria famlia...  Depois tem o que pode ser o refro dizendo para no nos enganarmos ou seremos pegos escorregando, a vem outra parte. Na parte da roupa fala da marca chique l: Gucci; que por sinal tem histrias sinistras na famila Gucci entre essas assassinato, disputa de poder e por a vai... Mas outra viagem minha aqui: tem a msica l do tal rapper, por sinal branco, Lil Pump que se chama inclusive Gucci Gang que s fala de ostentao, dinheiro e tudo mais, o que exatamente a letra da msica e o clipe se referem algumas vezes. Vejo nisso uma critica a at o que o rap se tornou na Amrica sem contedo e tambm como uma forma de esconder a realidade, no Brasil o Funk cumpre bem esse papel.; a msica negra que se perde no consumismo... Ele fala na msica ainda de ser bonito, vai mandar ver e nessa hora ele faz um pequeno sinal com as mos, algo parecendo um gesto feminino, parece quando algum diz: isso amiga,  isso dando um sorriso meio irnico. Enquanto isso no clipe o pau quebrando l atrs, policia e tudo mais. Na cena tambm comentada de algum pulando outra curiosidade, muita gente falando de um negro suicidando, mas a pessoa parecia estar bem vestida, diferente das outras pessoas; sei l, pode ser referncia a tambm alguma outra questo, o homem negro moderno que abandona sua histria... Na cena das crianas com celulares muitos falaram na msica de ser ferramenta (o celular), mas observei que as mesmas tambm estavam com uma especie de venda na boca, como se no pudessem falar, na msica ele fala da marca Kodak que por sinal faliu uma vez, o criador da marca inclusive suicidou-se por causa de uma doena que adquiriu: George Eastman. Uma vez Gambino deu uma entrevista dizendo como as redes sociais mascaram a realidade atravs da falsificao, ou, sub produo de pseudos sentimentos, ele demonstrou isso quando publicou uma carta e todos inclusive acharam que ele ia suicidar... Talvez para Gambino as redes sociais tambm escondem a realidade e silenciam sentimentos. Bom... vou para por aqui por enquanto, esse clipe tem ""pano pra manga"" (rsrs, gria antiga), tem tambm o Michael Jakcson l, o negro que queria virar branco... Sei no... Essa critica de Gambino vai muito alm do que a gente imagina...",1

He would not be on the trending list and no one would have found his small video !!!! But it fits the propaganda of the powers that should not be !!! So it's pushed and many follow in suit because they don't understand that they are nothing but slaves !!! It's sad that my brothers and sisters are too stupid to see the truth !!! Sure we don't want our children dying as they go to school !! But many realities we are shown are not always as they seem ! Sure people die and children die !!! But the reason they died and those behind this paradigm ??? You would only need to try to look at to our history and you might see their problems with look we are being told !!! The mainstream narrative control by those who should never be in power !!! The powers that should not be !!! They will destroy the common people and use them as they wish to !! Because we are nothing to these individuals ! They do things to us behind the scenes and we have no clue !!! Then they use things like sports and entertainment to keep us docile !!! Cuz you can't have real men and women !! They throw out different propagandas and men and women suck them up !!! Then they fight each other over who is best !!! The whole wild the nuclear family is destroyed !!! The common people are stupid !!! Until they wake up ??? They will stay slaves !!! Sad !!!,1

Media is creating gaps between, men and wmen, black and whites, black on black, white on white,politics right and left, sexuality, genders, religions, police, culture, guns do we have anything left to agree on and be peaceful about??? No!!!so far what IÕve seen and noticed trending on YouTube earlier is hanging a white kid, kill trump, gun control, weekend killing himself in false alarm, I feel so sorry for the kids watching, cuz the world is gonna be taken care of by the ones watched this the most. these new trendings creates just more of the problem it claims to speak about.and IÕm talking about every political manipulation, this is one of many seeds media is planting into the society which will then come to a reality one day. Look at every fucking video/news/trending now, they show only one what they want to create more of. Trending on YouTube is decided before itÕs even posted..IÕm so depressed about what the media is doing and nobody can see it, just pushing every brain into a meatgrinder to create more aggression in the world, break it down to build it up again in the way they want it to be, break it to build it. SO WHEN CHAOS COMES KNOCKING ON OUR DOOR, we better accept it, cause weÕre already doing it by accepting these subliminal messages.

21619,"Love the satire presented here... like the way the camera whips away (one time just as he's saying whip which was a nice touch) when shit in the background's about to get real, how after you've seen it a few times you want Donald to get out of the damn way so you can see what's really happening, in the same way you might want the surface-level rapping to stop masking the true violence happening to blacks in America with a feel good/drugged out message, the subtle way you can see him hiding behind that pillar from the start, the dude that falls off the balcony, the masked kids filming the riot for WSHH (I'm assuming), the way the third whipping out of the gun is subverted to reveal nothing in his hand as if to say 'Oh shit what'm I doing dancing when there's fucking cars on fire, better run!'. The double meaning of 'get down' due to the way it's distorted.... And of course the shootings are so well executed. I feel that the unique quality of a comedian is how they're able to set up juxtaposition in a way so absurd it heightens both the humor and the tragedy and feels more true than if someone plain said 'stop dancing on the grave of your fallen brothers'. I wasn't hip to Gambino before this but am very interested in his next album now. Good job.",1

Or was Donald trying to say something? Everyone just goes straight to gun debate & apparently deep seated racism of white Americans. I have a feeling that maybe Donald wanted to say something else instead:He, a black man, shot another black man in the beginning. Then he also shot up a singing choir. Everyone in the background destroying their own community are also black. Everyone who protected & carried away the guns and hid & dragged the corpses away were black. People ignoring everything, playing with their phones or just recording all of the madness happening around them are also black. And, most importantly, the distraction to it all, the dancers (representing the fake rapper gangster culture), were black too. And in the end he is trying to escape & run away from it all, because he is terrified, but people are chasing him, trying to drag him back to what heÕs trying to escape (not sure if they are white or black at this point, but IÕd assume itÕll be his own ÒcommunityÓ, just like in all the scenes that were seen before).There is no fucking way all of that was a coincidence, when everything else was so meticulously planned.",1

And how heÕs running away from everyone shows that alot of people thinkin they tough really arent wen its too many against them.

21736,Kanye aint fucking with BINO ______________,1
21737,Alot of people commenting on how this was 'deep' and love the the 'hidden message' like they know shit about what the song is about,1
21738,"Some people say that the song is shit and its only the video that matters and thats cool and all because everyone is entitled to their opinion  but i don't think thats the case. The song and video go together as a puzzle piece.  The video is just as important as the song, but the video certainly has more meaning behind it, simply because there's a lot and ""a pictures is like 1,000 words"". The song also  has a nice beat and I especially like African influences in the music.   I feel as though the chorus is really important as well. ""Grandma told me get your money, Black man. "" and ""You just a Black man in this world You just a barcode, ayy. You just a Black man in this world drivin' expensive foreigns. A reference to even though he's now succeeding "" getting his coin"" he will still feel discriminated against for the color of his skin and sadly there's nothing he can do about that. His Grandma speaks the truth even if its hard to hear, despite the fact that he's a multitalented artist, actor etc, he will always feel  in the eyes of others that he's  just another black man. Another important part is the children dancing around him.  We are so distracted by material things wether its technology, music, or trending styles  that we fail to see what's going on around us. The children are dancing around him as if nothing else in their lives matter, they treat him like a god as if he's the only thing that matters to them even though he himself is flawed. But the children/people won't see that  because they worship him just like other entertainers.  Theres a lot of issues both the song and the music video both  touch upon.  The way he put this together is genius.",1

I bet you fucks don't even realize that he's trying to make a point that people cause their problems and accentuate, then blame some higher power, when in reality, it's their fault, or how ghetto and deadbeat culture ""shoots down"" old culture and aspects of good that existed at one point in time, and I'm willing to bet that the point of black people doing violent things then blaming everyone else is missed by a lot of people, because you care more about where it's trending and if you saw SZA towards the end.",1

But if they did any type of research on the bullshit they speak on they would know that he has publicly talked about the fact that he has tried to date black women but he was mostly turned down because he was ""too nerdy"" or ""not black enough"" or was ""too weird""...basically not fitting the standard or image of what they THINK a black man should be based off of what society has labeled the 'norm' and honestly alot of black men like Donald have gone through the same shit and ended up ultimately dating outside their race because they weren't respected enough by our Queens to be given a chance.

Also, you can see how they did carry the gun away carefully but they didn't give a shit about the body, they did carry it away like shit, only so the media wouldn't see it. I also think this video is trying to say that having money is the only important thing in peoples eyes nowadays like when you see that boy throwing money in the air like it was nothing. I also think that this video is trying to say that it's still okay you can buy guns and everything even with all these school shootings and things like that but when you smoke/sell weed, the police is going to kick your ass.",1

I understand the imagery but just because a video shows someone with the cliche AK-47 shooting up a choir, or the cliche Beretta 9mm executing someone how does that make it a popular video? Now, I suppose someone is going to use the verbage that ""this represents our people"" and/or ""that this is what we go through on a daily basis"". My argument to that is that you have every opportunity to move and leave your current position at any time then you should. And stop using the excuse ""it's too hard"" or ""it's too difficult"", or ""you don't know what it's like"" Well actually yes I do and I have been in your position and made something of myself.

Basically the video is directed to the students (us), as throughout the video when we see the students, crazy shit is happening all around them and instead of caring, they are on top of cars with money guns, dancing, or sitting and just recording everything, etc. The students are supposed to represent what weÕre doing while people are getting killed in front of our face; weÕre turning a blind eye. Basically I believe the message of the video (mainly to the younger generation) is to instead of caring about KanyeÕs views, getting money & all this stupid shit, we instead need to start putting shit into perspective and care about shit that actually has an impact on the world, as we are the generation that decides whether the world continues going to shit or starts to change.",1

21897,"DAMN!!!! the shit just got real for real.... 130k thumbs down are the ppl who choose to keep their head in sand b/c the shit going on in their ""GREAT AMERICA"" will literally blow their fucking minds!!!!",1
21898,The taller dancing boy can't get it right for a shit,1
21899,"Lol look at all the angry ass uncultured swines that disliked this video __The only thing that makes me angry about this video is how true it is!!! ____________",1
21900,Fire Flame __ __  that shit goes,1
21901,This is shit lol,1
21902,"Im just gonna be honest, I think this song blows I would never listen to this. The cinematography is on point and the symbolism is awesome. Musically the song sucks ass.",1
21903,Lmao so fucking weird,1
21904,"What is the message here? Not sure. Is it , if reality sucks , just enjoy that blunt?",1
21905,"The beginning of the video, we see an elderly black man start playing the guitar, while a younger black man stands far away with his back turned. A sign of disrespect and a sign of not really wanting to pay attention to the traditional values of his elders.The camera then moves with the young black man who is dancing to the words, ""We just want to party."" This is showing that the younger black generations don't really want to look or pay attention to the issues going on, but would rather be consumed by partying and ""Goodtimes."" The younger blackman then kills the older blackman. Execution style. Followed by the words, ""This is America."" A clear message to the people who might not be aware that black on black violence is more real than you might realize. With statistics pointing to black on black crime being through the roof and most people in general are completely unaware of it. It also signifies that the younger generations of black people are destroying what their parents/ancestors built for them. Principles of working hard and respecting your elders. They are being destroyed by the black youth.It is made very clear that the young children that come and dance in the scenes are young. They wear schoolboy/girl outfits. It's also intentional that they are black. They dance around happily while so much violence is going on. No, they are not unaware of the killings of black folk, caused by black folk, they are willfully ignorant of it. Choosing to belief what they want to believe. If anyone said anything bad about black people, they are racist.We then see the chaotic riots going on. People running with masks, arms raised with weapons. A clear indication of the violent riots occurring after Trump took office. Pointing out the obvious: Glover is aware that after Trump took office, black people got mad and started rioting for some reason.The words ""This is America. Police be tripping though"" can be heard. This is showing again, the deluded perspective of gun control. After having just murdered someone, the young black man immediately refers to the fact that gun violence is a problem with police having guns. A clear hypocrisy, especially considering what he just did.The following part, ""Guns in my area. I need the strap"" The deluded black youth believe that having guns is necessary to combat police. However, will more than likely use their guns on other black people, further contributing to the problem of gun violence.""Imma go into this"" Could refer to the character in the song, or to the fact that Glover is ""Going in"" to the issue of the truth. Now, Donald is really smart. Like fuckin' genius levels. The dude isn't a dummy and with all of the shit going on in the video, he's more than capable of understanding what the hell is going on with black on black violence. Here he shows his true colors and where he stands. He is telling us the real problem.In the background, you can see a young black boy with a dollarbill-gun. A clear indication that the youth are being exposed to the strip-club culture at such a young age. A real tragedy. Heartbreaking loss of innocence.Cut to the choir singing. The choir represents the very strong affiliation that black people have with gospel music and church-culture. Only to be destroyed by the young black man. A clear sign of disrespect for the old beliefs held by the wiser generations of black people.After killing the choir, the young black man runs away from the police car. This signifies that even the police can't solve the problem. We then see the young black man walking again amidst chaotic riots. Out on the streets once more to do more damage to society. This is followed by a belligerent dance with other young black children. To signify the, ""IDGAF YALL AY LMAO""-attitude that is infecting the black youth these days. (Again, not a coincidence that black children were chosen to be portrayed in the music video. Very intentional)If you look closely, you can see a white man in a white shirt being thrown off the balcony. This signifies the misguided anger of black people. Ignorant of what the real problems are in America, they blame white people instead of taking responsibility. All while saying, ""I'm so pretty. I'm on Gucci"".The dancing black children are panned from and up to another group of young black children on their phones wearing riot masks. Again, to signify that they aren't unaware of the riots and black on black crime, but are willfully ignorant. Choosing to goof off and take selfies instead of try to fix the problems they are causing and are a part of. This is followed by another pan down to more black children dancing right next to a burning car. While a white horse rides by, representing death. But no one cares. They just dance.The words are spoken, ""Get your money black man.""This is huge. As a black man, the message to me is that Glover is talking to black people. All of the imagery and the cinematography is aimed toward black folk. It's a wake up call. We need to stop black on black violence.",1
21906,"Ok whether you agree or disagree with the message here, this was the most powerful ass music video I have seen in years! Tops beyonce's none sense ironic songs lol",1
21907,He sexy,1
21908,"So much I wanna say on this song but nothing is without purpose...Gambino using all of these different cameos to re-emphasize a point Phone from Little Brother made on this one song, Ò20 different variations of the same face/designed to keep yo broke ass in the same place.Ó (I.e. a distraction). Even in that you try to pay attention too hard to the wrong thing and you end up slipping.",1
21909,There is some crazy symbolism going on in this video not just visually  but also burried in the lyrics. I love coming up with my own theories about lines or why something happened in the music video. I want Donald Glover to sit down and give his explanation for everything also the director of the music video. But a part of me doesn't want D.G to spill the beans. Not knowing exactly what the artist intended doesn't limit the thoughts and ideas of audience. I don't know I fucking love the song and the video.,1
21910,"This is a real genius in my opinion and kanye west is not and was not ever shit to me. Donald Glover can do it all and make sense about what he is saying and doing. The show Atlanta is a good show, I love the way it is played.Where is ""Paper Boi"" LOL LOL",1
21911,This the hardest shit IÕve seen in a while !,1
21912,Gambino washed up. This shit is garbage,1
21913,Best video ever. Hands fucking down.,1
21914,"I donÕt get what heÕs trying to do. Bring up something that gets everyone pissed off and separates us even more? IÕm tired of seeing people complain about this type of stuff but then if you ask them they have no solutions to the ÒproblemsÓ.  Like are you trying to make people think racism and police brutality is bad. Most people already fucking know that. And deep down you guys know that the majority of people arenÕt like that. Now IÕm not going to be naive or ignorant and say there is absolutely no racism or police brutality that goes on, because I know there is. BUT SERIOUSLY I DONT UNDERSTAND THE FUCKING POINT. IÕm so tired of seeing people complain and get angry. Like if youÕre so fucking mad come up with ways to solve the problems instead of getting pissed and complaining about them and expecting other people or the government to come up with ways to fix the problems for you.",1
21915,So much shit going on you almost don't notice the 21 Savage ad-libs.,1
21916,why  the 37k dislike?? fuck idiots,1

Please U.S.A please build a great wall on all your borders and dont let anyone in . This comment is meant to make you think about it The world starts to feel fed up with U.S.A shits all over the world . Be carful because this plant is shared with other races and people who want to live thier on style of life and your govermentS ALL your GOVERMENTS are treating lots of people around the world with fear and threating of destroying...

21929,HeÕs fucking back!,1
21930,"You can also say despite him commiting some shocking murders, it's inevitable in this generation that we still gonna get lit to the dance moves he does after showing how we just forget shit like nutting acting like our favourite artists or some shit aren't criminals",1

I understand songs can be political and dope, many artist and bands have done this, but I find this viewpoint and subject matter kinda immature and ignorant.

I won't read your comment or reply if you @ me so don't waste your time, spend it thinking from another viewpoint and see if your opinion changes when you see facts and ditch the bandwagon",1

21948,Like I donÕt give a shit about the meaning. I know itÕs a meme and that the song was actually garbage.,1
21949,"Race bating (check), Promoting hatred (check) Full of far left agenda promoting (check)... He's promoting the idea that white America is out to kill black people, which is ridiculous and irresponsible! Statistically blacks committed 25x more crimes against whites than whites against blacks in this country, but that's not the point of this video. The point is to promote separatism, hatred, and fallacy, while Gambino makes a fortune while bending over and taking it up the butt for the left agenda... Sick and sad. ps: you dance like you have a firecracker up your ass. Not cute.Andre 3000 does that dance a million times better...because he's just promoting MUSIC, not an agenda.",1

21951,"Gee, I remember when Gambino made rap, not shitty student art projects.",1
21952,"this is not a ""song"" just a political statement and social manifesto, very subjective by the way, its cool, but cmon Donald glover can do way much better, stop politicizing everythig, we look to the musicians, actors , artists etc to get entertained and distracted, for this shit i watch the news and the internet everyday.",1
21953,Anybody care to help a white dude understand this video? Is he basically saying that everybody only cares about trends and dances when real shit is going on they should be focused on?,1
21954,I thought this was a bit shit,1
21955,"I think what this video represents is how we don't know what is going on in the world, and that there is chaos. And I think what childish Gambino is representing is the rappers today and how they distract us from what's going on, and the kids might represent the new generation which is us and yall seen how even after he committed a crime these kids were still dancing with him, maybe that shows that even though these rappers talk about killing, we still fuck with their song..and yeah that's just my opinion tho.",1

There is no law keeping you from doing anything you want wether your black white, straight gay, democrat or republican. Maybe the reason people still feel oppressed is because they are doing it to themselves, they were put into boxes in the past but theyÕre not now... they can leave. And the idea that blacks are being killed by cops is untrue, more whites are killed by cops than blacks almost every year. I know IÕll be called a racist, trans/homo phobe for this bit it needs to be said, this self victimization bull shit is getting real old... it needs to stop.",1
22029,"My interpretation, heÕs saying black people are killing themselves by not fighting back against racism and police brutality, because their too focused on unimportant things like looks, fashion, and entertainment, and also are using their faith as an excuse to not fight back. HeÕs telling people to wake the fuck up, and stop playing, shits real in Amerikkka..He almost looked like he was possessed in the beginning like he was under mind control, and was torn between being black and doing the will of the elite against his own people. Another thing I noticed was the contrast between what he was talking about and the difference being evident in the Òpoor people carsÓ, the kids on the balcony could mean this generation isnÕt paying attention anyway, so your wasting your time. Sacrificing the soul of his people for success could be another theme in the video. Dope AF. This guy is a fucking genius.",1

Its refreshing to see someone real keeping it real. Boy expressing the shit out his self its beautiful to watch! It feels like commentary on black culture and how we all can actively participate in destructive habits and go so far as to do it with a smile on our face. It speaks to me of priority in our culture. Tge bipolar nature of our culture. And the result if we continue down this path we are on collectively. I'm sure in completely missing the mark here lol how it made me feel tho.,1

22167,"Bad shit happens in any country. America has many activists and voters with good intentions. Everyone has a unique life experience and point of view on what will make the world a better place (except probably most politicians, but even that is up for debate) and people will always strongly disagree with the other viewpoint and portray them as having ill-intent.Regardless of all that, I think it's important to recognize that just because some of us can have fun in America (just as they can in all other regions of the world) doesn't mean we are devoid of activism. There needs to be a balance so we can enjoy our life. I think that is what makes America great though, is that we are free to enjoy ourselves and within the law do practically whatever we want (in contrast to most other regions of the world). There will always be the 'Big Brother' and there will always be criminals and death. But in America it's surprisingly more tame than in other places and it exists because of the laws in place, even though some or many of them are bullshit (and there are MANY more laws in general than one might realize, so that makes up a vast minority)Some may see America as a regressing country and in many ways it is, but in many ways I also see it getting better. We can recognize the bad sides, but the majority of people in America reading sensationalist headlines all the time is fueling a fire that is in my opinion far overblown, and music videos like this tap into that fear and exacerbate it. Even though it's within our rights to express ourselves in this way, in my personal opinion I find it pessimistic and I think all it does is emit a negative vibe through our communities. Promote peaceful activism by encouraging others to vote on specific issues on specific dates! Keep track of that stuff and act on it and we will have a better America.",1

22202,"This Is America is a 5/5 music video with a 3/5 instrumental and 2-3/5 lyricism. To be specific, it's the gunshot scenes that make it jarring.Surely artistic critique needs to go deeper than shock value music videos.It's a little ham fisted. Which was my problem with TPAB too. Which is what Kanye's getting at - it's shallow, bereft-of-nuance grievance porn that people like Obama tacked on to because it's simplistic enough to appeal to the lowest common denominator white guilt and Obama, like any good politician (no hate, it's means justifying ends in a lust for power), is a whore for cheap and safe publicity and popularity-by-association.Hence elevation of people like Kendrick, Jay-Z and Gambino who know how to behave and act like revolutionaries within black spaces but are smart enough not to make waves and rock the boat when participating in bigger, more powerful and impactful white institutions.Kanye doesn't give a fuck. He's doing actual glass ceiling shattering in the pro league while those three are doing it in their local highschool league. White people don't care who the king of hiphop is, they don't want to be king of the ghettos. They care when you're trying to knock Louis Vuitton off its throne. They want to be king of the upper classes.This is why what Kanye's doing is a million times more impactful to race relations and class relations than anything anyone in hiphop has/is doing.Obama also took a shot at the heavyweight belt but was ""too perfect."" He made it theoretically possible but unless you're a handsome, intelligent, harvard educated AND well connected sleazebag who owes favours to every power player in Chicago AND are hella fake, media trained. Unless you're all of that, nothing really changed. Kanye's doing something much more impactful.",1

Because we've got black people running around claiming blacks are better than whites and nobody says anything. We've got blacks demanding properties and money from whites for crimes not committed and nobody says anything. We've got blacks killing blacks in mass numbers and nobody says anything. We've got blacks being real racists and nobody says anything.The police are not racist:blacks are just committing more crimes than other people. This is an objective truth. Don't commit crimes, and you won't be arrested. Don't look suspicious and you won't be stopped by the cops. Don't be belligerent and disrespectful and you won't be manhandled by the cops.Your actions have consequences people.

People donÕt like the idea of someone saying something against a government that cares more about votes than the lives of their people. They donÕt want admit that the system they live in is flawed and that someone is speaking out against it even though what Glover is talking about is true, This is America guns and violence are seen as the norm, they are normalized and expected to happen and they are held up on a pedestal wile the people murdered are considered no better than trash.

22269,"Things people have still missed:- Shades of blur throughout the video demonstrate the level of priority we put into issues. Celebrities such as childish gambino/donald glover in the front, things that are trending such as dancing next, until the most blurry of all, the actual shit that's ""relevant"" such as protests, attacks and politically/racially fueled acts. The only thing that isn't blurred that's ""relevant"" is the mass murder of the priests which represnts the church shooting in Texas. This is due to the fact that the only time we actually start talking about something. - 1:33 we see a kid holding a supreme money gun (it's what I call it don't judge). Again falls back to the previous points of priority through blur, he's easily seen yet the protests behind him aren't. We value the overpriced goods and throw money anywhere we want rather than paying attention to what's important. - Funny how priests are singing ""get your money black man"" when Christianity is designed for you to value the spiritual and un-tangible. Also exposes the money exploitations of churches throught America and the world. - 2:13 cop runs with the crowd away from the problem. Represents cops (not all of them, there are good cops) lack of training and courage to handle a situation. Shows kids recording cop showing how recording devices on phones help identify cops behaving unprofessionally. Kids recording have multiple meanings, this is just the one no one has talked about the most. Thank you if you've read this far, it's a long read.",1

22284,this is to fucking far,1
22285,I like how its traditional african bear in the beginning then after he shoots the beat switched to trap sorta how america rids of the beatiful traditions. Trapping us in the american mindset. Too many messages in the song you must go to dissect university to get this shit,1
22286,By the fact that it's trending as well as the 150k+ comments you can tell this says a lot. Gambino never ceases to amaze me in everything he does. I type feel bad for Pirating his old shit on my 4+ years old PC,1
22287,shit I cant find my comment that I wrote yesterday __,1
22288,"Gonna run down a list of all the symbolic imagery I was able to pick up on. Add any if you think I missed a few1. The pants he's wearing aren't just random bum pants. They were commonly worn by confederate soldiers way back when.2. His wonky eye expression was purposely done to draw allusions to uncle ruckus, a character from the Boondocks who is essentially a self loathing black man.3. The pose he struck upon shooting the tied up black man was a reference to the Minstrel, a racist caricature by Jim Crow.4. Notice how after his first shooting, a man comes along to take the gun in a silky red cloth. Handling with the utmost love and care. Meanwhile, the body of the black man is dragged away like garbage.5. The kids don't seem to be paying attention to what's happening around them. They're too focused on gambino. And Gambino keeps looking back at the kids to make sure they're mimicking him. At one point before the scene transition he even motions at them to mimick him. He's forcing them to go along with the latest dance crazes and trends. He is distracting them from the horrors of 'america'. Probably making some kind of allusion to mainstream media and the entertainment business as a whole.6. Obvious reference to the shooting done by dylan roof when he gunned down those choir singers.7. Yet again, a man comes to take the gun away in a silky red cloth with the utmost care. The bodies of the choir are left to rot because they aren't as important as the gun.8. Gambino tries extra hard to keep our attention now. Constantly saying things like. ""I'm so pretty. Watch me move. etc etc"" He's distracting extra hard now that chaos seems to be in full swing with riots, suicides (A man jumps off the balcony to his death), black on black crime, police brutality, etc all unfold around the kids.9. The grim reaper rides in on a pale horse.. I think that was a bit much, but okay Gambino.10. The kids and Gambino all seem to finally wake up to what's happening. The kids run away in fear when Gambino makes a gun motion (But he's unarmed). But rather than acknowledge the situation, he just smokes a blunt and goes right back to dancing.11. There are several cameos by popular rappers and personalities all over the song. They are meant to distract you as well. One moment you're in shock that gambino shot people, but the next you go ""OH SHIT THAT'S YOUNG THUG I KNOW THAT GUY!""Overall the video's touched on a number of issues happening in america, but those are just surface level callouts. The true purpose behind this video is the distraction. The whole point of the song was to have all these atrocities happening, but to distract us with the flashy dance moves, the banging beat and the  cameos because THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN REAL LIFE. We've been through several horrible atrocities thus far, we get offended for like a week, then we're talking about what Kanye said about slaves or what crazy shit is happening in the world of politics. We're all being distracted and desensitized to the horrible things happening right in front of us. This is America.",1
22289,"Oh cool another ""controversial"" music video for people to over think on and assume it's about racism and how black people are mistreated by our judicial and protective services. Blame the youth, they're the ones being fed this horse shit about America's supposed mistreatment on anyone who isn't white. Bless this country, racism is only getting worse.",1

22307,"For everyone, this song is about BLACK SOICETY. He references Jim Crow in the beginning of the video. Only black people had to deal with Jim Crowism. It's an artistic critique on this American empire that continues to segregate, and slaughter BLACK people. Hence the killing of the quire that in reality happened to them.  Black people, since they got here, use song and dance to express the pains and frustrations that they as a community have to deal with. He's really no different then what Billie Holiday sung about in strange fruit. All you non-blacks just want to attach yourselves to some dope black shit cause all of you know black people make dope shit...",1

22331,Imagin watching this shit while high,1
22332,Finally on fucking trending,1
22333,"I wanna talk about the comments section and the video itself for a sec. A lot of people are talking about how this isn't ""anything new"", and how most people already knew about the fucked state we're in. Well of course people already knew. You knew, I knew, and most of the country + outside people knew. But that's not the point. C'mon, did you _honestly_ think that Glover wasn't aware of people knowing about this? Of course he was. The point isn't that people aren't aware of what's going on, the point is that people *aren't addressing it* . We see what's going on, but we choose to ignore it. Another thing I wanna talk are the ""distractions"". A surprisingly amount of people said that their attention was diverted from the stuff happening in the background, and ultimately most people are saying that the distractions are a negative. But are they really? In my opinion, no. All the so called negative distractions aren't all that bad on their own. A lot of us are living difficult lives and we search for outlets so we can feel good once every so often and not be in a constant state of depression and misery. Plus we like sharing things that interest us with friends, which isn't bad. It's only truly bad when you let that stuff divert you from what's actually going on, or better yet let it deceive you. Now one could argue that Gambino's dancing and lyrics were trying to trick you, but Gambino is no stranger to music videos that don't match with the song but in a way oddly do. I know it's not that black and white, but that's just my take. Ultimately my interpretation of this video is that it's a mix of a lot of different issues and problems within America that we are ignoring. Instead of trying to find a solution, we turn to other things because a lot of us(myself included) look for things to enjoy and help us get through those rough times, which isn't bad. But at the same time we let this stuff occupy us to the point where issues that need to addressed and dealt with aren't taken care of. That's the point if you ask me. Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeell, there are multiple points since this video can be perceived and interpreted in multiple ways, but that's a discussion ya gotta with yourself before going to anyone else. It's fun to think about things in your head and then share your thoughts with others while hearing their thoughts and ideas. There are a lot of people who will definitely disagree with me, and I'm more than open for discussion, so if you got something you want to say here, say it. That's what a comments section is made for right? Just don't come off as a pretentious ass when doing so. No one likes a pretentious ass. Except in fiction.-I'm not even gonna bother with a TL;DR because this is a type of discussion that couldn't possibly be shortened down to a few words. Also forgive any spelling typos or mistakes you see.-",1

22347,"It seems really hyperbolic, coming from the comments, to make conclusions on the message of the video when the video itself is extremely vague in what America 'is'. And if America is some kind of racist supremacy against the blacks, it just goes to show the continual victim complex that a lot of black people feel the need to hoist above personal accountability. Not to mention coming from Donald glover, a man who has had success in the music and film industry quite recently, makes the notion ever more weaker being spoken by him. But If  his message is of that America is 'killing' music (by him shooting the blues player and the church choir) then he is no better than America with this dreary, repetitive mumble rap he's doing in the very song. Or I guess that's supposed to be ironic? And if his message is about police brutality and how perpetrators of violence can get away with (because I'm sure that Dylan rooth isn't serving multiple life sentences for his massacre, of which the video was alluding to) then why is it everyone in the comments want to resolve that with MORE violence? Honestly, I looked at the shit going on in the background, and most of it is people running around aimlessly. The message, however people want to construe it as being 'deep' or 'woke' is all over the place, and maybe THAT'S what America is: chaotic.",1

22406,"IÕm white. Live a white life. Here is my interpretation.Song starts with Mr. Martin full face. We get the happy go lucky black man dance and then all of a sudden shot to the head. ItÕs an era of how we expected blacks to act a certain way or die. A lot of the push back is about how blacks are now representing themselves and how the white man is pointing their fingers AGAIN at how the black person chooses to represent themselves or live their life. The shooting of Mr. Martin shows that in the violence we have, many blacks have no face value. ItÕs also a representation of Jim Crow. We cut to a scene of dancing with private school dressed blacks. He dances for awhile and so do they, but yet no one is paying attention to this progress. Many people who watch this video point out the violence in the background during this shoot. Again, pay attention to the blacks doing good. Then cuts to church. When a person of white/black/any color can do what roof fuckboy did...itÕs a sad time. Cut back to more dancing (all along as a distraction as our media and moral standards are) we get to a black man surrounded by old bear up discarded cars. Discarded feelings and discarded placement. He stands on top of them smoking a cigarette of whoever cares whatÕs inside. The last scene goes black. Then it shows him running. HeÕs not running from cops...., but our shitty thought process on everything. Look closely...the people behind him are not cops but trying to keep up and leave Òthis AmericaÓ. Ps IÕm a white man.",1

22418,What's funny is how everything now is directed towards white people. Let me say this then murders in Chicago Detroit is it white people shooting blacks or black people shooting each other?  Oh now let me guess its white people putting the guns in their hands ? Oh wait no let me guess its white people putting u in a gang that calls for u to murder each other right ? Riiiiiiiiiiiiiight. What was the color of the judge that locked up meek and wanted him to fry ? Definitely not white. Who got meek out ? I'm pretty sure white guys I'm not racist I have a brother that's black but i'm sick of this now.  I work for a black man that's self made in his 50s and is a millionaire. If I remember correctly it was JFK and Lincoln that died for standing up. It's cool for Chris rock to say we should murder all white kids in his stand up and no one says shit. Imagine if Joe Rogan said that about black kids or Tom segura in their stand up ? Dave Chappelle got 50 mill to do his stand up for Netflix and this irrelevant bitch monique talking about discrimination. Lmao bitch ur 60 and haven't done shit since 92. Btw Amy Schumer sucks balls too and is wack. Look all I'm saying is I'm sick of it being ok now to bash white people. I'm pretty sure noone now even has a member in their family that was a slave at this point. Stfu already stop crying and fckin GRIND TO GET OUT OF WHATEVER SITUATION YOU'RE IN.,1

While America is pot of issues that are detrimental to all of its population, we'd rather ignore it and choose to remain fixated to our self-image. The contrast of the well-lit studio with the ending is sort of like our problems, the darkness catching up to us, and it's only when it's too late to do something that we choose to address the problem. Childish Gambino, is, in short, a genius and this song is a mad banger too.",1

22686,"My thoughts on the Childish Gambino video for the song ÒThis Is AmericaÓ... tell me what yÕall think...1. The video is set in a warehouse: the definition of a warehouse is- a large building where raw materials or manufactured goods may be stored before their export or distribution for sale.2. In the warehouse, in walks a black man who sits at a chair and plays a guitar with African inspired chants/music plays in the background. This man and the music represents the roots of black music in its most rare untainted form.3. Childish Gambino starts dancing to the lyrics ÒWe just want to party/Party just for you/We just want the money/Money just for youÓ. His eyes bulging, facial expressions and dance moves are all reminiscent of a minstrel show performer. *In this scene he represents the new black artists(hip hop in particular- You can hear adlibs from some of todayÕs popular rappers throughout the song.)* Childish dances up to the man with the guitar-who no longer has the guitar-who now has a cloth bag over his head like a hostage victim. Childish pulls out a gun and shoots the man in his head. He then hands the gun off to a kid dressed in a school uniform. *This represents how the roots and soul of black music has been taken hostage and killed by coons out to make a dollar. And this violent image of blackness is being manufactured and sold to the world (including our own youth).* After the shot rings out Childish raps the lyrics ÒThis is AmericaÓ.4. Childish then begins to rap and dance again- now with a group of black kids in school uniforms. There is chaos happening in the background (people running around with guns, bats, throwing money ...etc)-but the dancing continues...5. A gospel choir joyfully sings the lyrics ÒGo and tell somebody/Grandma told me/ Get your money/ Black man get your moneyÓ Childish still dancing, pauses to catch a semiautomatic weapon in his hands, then unleashes fire on the singing choir. *This represents the Charleston massacre.* After firing, he raps the lyrics ÒThis is AmericaÓ.6. The chaos happening in the background is building into a riot (smoke, police cars, cars on fire...etc) Childish and the kids continue to dance as if nothing is happening. *This represents how too many black hip hop artist are ignoring the current state of their people, they are too busy chasing money and selling a destructive image to our youth...It also shows how the world is dancing to our music and enjoying our culture, but will still murder us and not bat one eye.*7. Kids with their faces covered catching the riot or murders on their phones. Also there was the rider of the white horse whoÕs face was covered. *This couldÕve represented the KKK or the ÒWhite Rider of the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse.*8. Then the music stops and the kids all run away. Childish is frozen in place like he is in a deep sleep. Then he awakens, lights a joint, then the music starts again. *He has an epiphany *9. Childish then says ÒAmerica, I just checked my following list and YOU MOTHAFUCKAS OWE ME!...Get your money black manÓ *This could be a reference to reparations or money owed to black artists in general -or both*10. Childish then climbs on top of a car and starts dancing (reminiscent of Michael Jackson dancing on a car during his trial-and issues with Sony) with the lyrics ÒBlack man get your moneyÓ(*reparations*) repeating over and over...11. The Black man he shot at the beginning is still alive, and still playing his guitar. But his head is still covered *The soul of black music didnÕt die, itÕs still being held hostage, but there is still hope.* 12. The camera cuts to a new scene with a new song. In the scene Childish is running for his life. He is being chased by a mob of people,but their faces are blurred out. It looks like the mob has people of all races and genders chasing after him, but again they are blurred... *Im not too sure what to make of this scene, except maybe once you Ôwake upÕ and know your worth and your peopleÕs worth you will be attacked-from all sides...IDK*....The lyrics to the new song are ÒYou just a black man in this world/ You just a barcode,aye/ You just a Black man in this world/ Drivin expensive foreigns, aye/ You just a big dawg, yeah/ I kenneled him in the backyard/ No probably ainÕt life to a dog/ For a big dogI think this video is pretty genius myself...Tell me what yÕall think?Do you agree with my assessment or nah? Did I miss anything? Let me know...",1

22735,"This is an important piece of ART work - and like all art, the reason why he will not comment is because every individual viewer will bring her/his own life experiences to the interpretation, plus their knowledge of social/political events and history. Like the ART in the old masters, there is so much symbolism and we can only help each other extrapolate meaning and decipher the message his genius has created, and yes, I think this is absolute Genius. During the 60's you had the music of civil rights era which on the surface had a good soulful tune, but when you listened to the lyrics were referencing the racism embedded from slavery. Think Marvin Gaye  - What's Happening Brother, What's Going On - This, like that, is a WAKE UP CALL. From the opening frame of a guitar on a chair - Why? Symbolism - what is the significance of the guitar in music and the  African forced into slavery? The bedrock of popular music started with the African creativity of the Blues, where rock n roll comes from, where so many musical styles come from. The  musician is dressed in clean clothes, reminiscent and not dissimilar to and enslaved African, or you could see Brazilian, the guitar when you look is old, look at the patina - this references history of music. When we see him again, his  clothes are dirty like an enslaved African/American, head covered for hanging/lynching? The opening music he plays on guitar is, I believe West African High Life/or another African nation = the brilliance of this opening is the Roots - the visibility of the black body, how it moves to its original African rhythmical music. The origin of contemporary dance moves, borne out of traditional African dance, he visually celebrates what so many younger people have no memory of - the joy of the lost creative body movement that was enslaved and denied expression, as it was too frightening to the slave master. Look at the freedom in those movements. This is Genius because it is so rich and so multi layered. Yes, he wants you to see what is going on in the background, BUT he wants us to also see, and witness what has been lost in the roots of our dancing and from where it came. Bwoy, there is so much to write .... Please understand I am sharing my interpretation, just to think out loud. The language used Whipping, Get your money - I believe is a comment on how Black people  have lost sight of their own meaning. By chasing money, they will do whatever, even kill their own brothers and sisters. Yes, this is about Police murdering Black men, and the racist disproportionate violence against black bodies, (female and male), but I believe also about Black people lost in the chaos of Capitalism and chasing superficiality, that they kill their own for a dollar. Who saw the kid on car pumping out dollar bills - again a celebration of money over human connections. Black America buys into narrative that MONEY is everything, and do whatever to get it, in hope in answers all their individual woes to get out, but the Racist Brutality continues and not just by The KKK Police but themselves, as well. As a people are you lost? Do you need to reconfigure your focus on what is important. The White man is 'Whipping' (listen to the lyrics) you still, by distracting you with drugs for money, social media for ego gratification. When he pulls out the spliff/blunt, is this another distraction, black people are lost in getting high as a way to cope with their own destruction and pitiful reality of poverty, as its too painful? When he jump on the car and throws the spliff/blunt away, that move is Get Down Godfather of Soul James Brown, again highlighting how the black body moves adapts and still influences culture past and present.   Of course, what others have said is valid, about us being distracted on first viewing and not seeing the chaos and carnage in the background, but he wants us to see all the layers, so the dancing is significant too, and why it is African dance moves - celebrate your heritage and get to know the pure absolute joy of your rightful dance, that the slave master wanted beaten out of you - as its pure freedom scared the shit outta the - but hey, I've said enough. I may not get some of the references specific to American culture, but in UK we too are suffering with the stupidity of Black on Black killings - there is no need for the KKK or the NF or BNP in Uk cos they don't have to kill 'niggas' cos we doing it for them. The Black man is in crisis and the ultimate self harm is to kill yourself, your own kind, your brother. The system laughs at you, cos you so stupid you killing yourselves -  your are committing self hard, suicide, see the body jump off - killing yourselves - WAKE UP BROTHERS AND SISTAS 0- WAKE THE F**K UP - this in a brilliant contemporary  comment for 2018 but it's been done before - take a look at The Last Poets, Gil Scott Heron and take a look at Black Man In  A White World Michael Kiwanuka (I'm sure Glover nods to this 2015/6). This a 21stC contemporary Hogarth painting - a moving picture - a piece of performance ART.I want to know significance of the CARS - I know cars are valued in US like guns, hence as other say, why they are treated gently and caressed in red cloth for Republican NRA protection more so than HumanBeings - but I'm lost on the cars. They are of a particular age, so would love to hear somebody's interpretation. But that said this is F***ing GENIUS GENIUS GENIUS XXXXXX Love It",1

22746,"I can appreciate all the opinions given but, I believe this video is about America, yes as a whole (with all Americans blanketed) & the Black experience in America dealing and/or coping with the elites agenda. How brainwashing Willie Lynch syndrome is still manufactured with expensive things (clothes, jewelry, cars, designer drugs, etc.) & ÒflexingÓ (showing off) on all social media. Literally, just be better than that ÒniggaÓ & theyÕll let you get a seat at the table, piece of the American dream. The tribal & spiritual hymns to drums, Gambino dancing in tribal way then to the strings of the worn guitar the black man with no shoes on but, clean clothes plays...then Gambino hits the Jim Crow pose and executes a now dirty clothed, beaten, and shackled black man, hands off a now concealed gun in a red cloth stating, ÒThis is America.Ó The death of the old school mainstream hip hop was killed by drill, trap, & mumble-rap music for example, maybe. Wow, so much symbolism in 15 seconds or less. These new dance/rap challenges for the Gram to deflect whatÕs actually going on (employment, social security, healthcare, housing, interest rates, economy, police, legislature, taxes, social reform, pill addiction, meth addiction, contraception, suicide rates, etc.). Cooning & reckless behavior for likes, getting to the chicken (money), yes, there were actual chickens & money machines from strip clubs in the video __, a lifestyle all the youngsters & young adults adore currently but, are living in neighborhoods where the feeling is they need a gun to be safe so, now the dilemma of for or against gun control. People generally, posting/recording crimes before calling for help with that same phone, a problem. The choir or graduates executed can mean both massacres symbolized, but, the white horseman followed by the police is definitely police brutality & the Marshall Law in the foreseen future of America. But guess what, Black people get that chicken, get you debt up, dance & coon away from what you know is right to follow the idiot masses following another idiot because you trying to survive in America. He realizes the bs heÕs always known, inhales joint, everything clean again, reoccurring black man playing the music of our elders is clean again but still blind, a girl known for singing about glorifying a side-chick looks like a respectable black queen celebrated amongst a woke Gambino & abandoned cars. I think he & then others are Americans as a whole need to get from the sunken place the elite created for us all. Gambino gave a Black experience through the evolution of music because it is a very powerful outlet & apart of his own journey of experiences.",1

22938,"He is so talented that I have to say that I honestly think he took the easy road on this one. He could have made this so much more by filling in those simple chorus mantras with more face punches.

22944,I fuck with this,1
22945,"What i got from this is the music video points out the problems of the unjust treatment of the black community in america but also shows the ridiculousness of some of the things that are in pop culture and the only messages that those things send, i also feel like the lyrics are purpously written so that it reprsents literally every modern and mainstream rap song and the things done by those rappers without actually naming any contraband or anything important and how as much as the rapper should be highlighting whats happening all around him he still focuses on the current most popular dance and chattin shit about how much money, guns gang shit he hasSo CG is takin shots at all sides of america in a bunch of different metaphorical wayAll in all this is pretty lit and a bit of a directory masterpieceYurt",1

22954,"Idk how to interpret this, idk if this is about how fucked America is rn with gun violence terrorism factory workers nd trump (trump hat at the beginning), or if itÕs about black people stereotypes - criminal/factory worker/terrorist which leads to him being chased by police at the end as this is what they assume whenever they see a black person, this is also helped shown by the suit trousers and shoes as they donÕt really fit with the stereotypes, more like working clothes? Idk, itÕs a fucking good video tho, fuck me,  thatÕs what a music video is meant to do (make you think). What do people think",1

22960,Another black American bitching about the USA. It's MOSTLY black Americans who just look for the bad in the USA and can't see the positive. They have the highest standard of living of any black population in the world by a considerable margin (thanks to living amongst high functioning and high IQ white Americans of northern European heritage who maintain the most advanced civilizations along with East Asians) and yet all they can do is bitch about everything and not appreciate the luxuries they have.,1

22976,"This is cancerous, this coon has the body of a 60 year old midget. Who the fuck is this guys anyway is he a fag?",1
22977,"If anyone sees this comment discuss this with me: People have attributed the first shooting scene to be representative of a Jim Crow poster right? What if the reasons he makes these exaggerated dances the entire time is because HE IS JIM CROW. Jim Crow has evolved into distracting the nation of the obvious bullshit going on by making new trendy dances, and having the token blacks on its side so it isn't ""racist"". That could also explain why the lyrics say ""Get yo money black man"" because black people nowadays just wanna ""get money and fuck bitches"". That point could segue into another saying that mumble rap and ""thug culture"" is an extension of Jim Crow by telling Black people to throw their own under the bus for a couple of dollars. There's so much to this music video I love it",1
22978,This shit is so whack. White people music. I miss chief keef era rap. That was real shit. Not this pussy ass faggot shit,1

22980,"Cold ass song",1
22981,"What he was saying was... out of all the shit that's happening to black folk,  we managed to put more priority into rap music, gun violence on ourselves over nothing,  social media,  dancing, praying about it... all while hiding behind  fake christianity, instead of focusing demolishing racism and other community issues which btw keeps us from fighting back! So when presented with a problem,  we don't speak up, or fight back we just run,  just as we were taught to do by the massa!",1
22982,Best video in 2018 PERIOD all the junkie trash ass rappers take notice,1

Shit people think about but on a grand scale, feel like they cant do shit.

Maybe he has balls to say sonething, show something...but DO SOMETHING? ......naw. Go buy his album (tho).",1
22994,"I wish the song was 6 minutes, I wish he had more visuals and another verse! If youÕre in opposition to this song and itÕs message, and youÕre from the US... your ass is one of the fucking issues in society. People love being in denial about whatÕs going on here, whatÕs been going on here. Mfs want to paint America as one of the best places to start a new life when in reality this is a sneaky cunning manipulative ass country who will bend you over and fuck you in the ass with no Vaseline, kill your son, numerous of teens go missing that were never accounted for. A country where they lie and scheme to get ahead in everything. A place where innocent people get killed by cops who are here for our protection and nothing is done about it. A place where if two men one black and one white commits the same crime, the justice will not end with the same results. Fuck America and all you scary ass rasicts Americans. I am not proud of this deceptive ass country.",1

23018,my opinion is he maybe was on som shit maybe he was not . He closed his eyes an thought of america. In the backround one of his friends was playing music (the happy parts in the video) but his homie kept in skipping the songs to find a better one (killed the good thought (the people) ). And this is America . If everybody would let the music play song after song (the way of life) and wouldnÔt try to find a way to get more money or smth. (a better song). Everybody could go his own way and the ãvibeÒ of life wouldnt be interuoted and killed of the will getting smth. better . (sorry 4 ma shitty english),1

Get that moneyAnd all they are singing about is contrabands, hundred bans, whips and likes.The entire time, Gambino isn't the main feature, he's just a distraction...

It's hard to stay positive with all this shit happening around our world and most people just worrying about the stupid ones on TV.I saw a man about to jump from a bridge about a month ago. The traffic on the other side of the freeway was stopped. It hurt to watch that and the police trying to reason with him. Though what hit very hard, was the fireman's reaction underneath as he dragged his feet to the firetruck. Non-chalant. Sort of blank. So desensitized.Sometimes I seriously wonder if we're starting to becoming that way too and that's part of the reason why some of us ignore the actual problems- not because we don't care.",1

I would like to ask the viewers of color this: How do you view the old (66) white dudes who want you to have the same opportunities as the privileged ass hole?. It's easy to blow me off as having White Guilt, but I've never really had shit after working my ass off for 45 years. I'm in no way comparing my life experience with any  person of color, because they always have been and still are treated like shit by us the old white assholes. But do you accept that there really are some of us who truly want you and your children and grandchildren to walk alone at night without fear? I hope so. If we don't work together, it won't work.",1

23096,Some bomb ass water at 3:32,1
23097,"Another person (glover) being a hypocrite.When people make these types of videos the big thing to remember is that history doesnt go back 300 years, it goes back millions, for the Human race. In the case of glover, he forgets Africans have a few thousand years of atrocities to answer for but refuse to. That is some heritage Africans want to ignore.In the case of glover he forgets thousands of years of African atrocities against countless countries and societies that are lost to time, violent actions, ""the world falling apart"", Africans creating slavery long before the north american continent was even named.BUT....in order to sell the victim card and profit from it the clueless masses that suck worthless information from vids like this one  like it was a documentary, glover has to not include disclaimers like........Disclaimer: The USA has done some bad things to some Africans but nothing compared to what Africans did to Africans and Africans contniue to do so to each other in the name of blaming anyone but themselves.Why say your own people are worse than the people you try to blame when it takes away from your message? glover obviously doesnt mind forgetting history as long as it fits his agenda and others like him.Come on glover, stand up like a man, admit ""your"" people caused, and are a large part of your own problems in present day society because of ""your"" past actions, then maybe we can begin to heal the hate.Everyone else admits they are making mistakes and not being sensitive enough, they are being to hard on Africans in the USA, that all the crime committed is just lopsided because of profiling, etc, etc. Everyone is admitting fault........Excpet one ethnic group.......this group admits to nothing, will not accept they are part of the problem in open news, and refuses to state their history of ethnic violence in Africa and spread throughout the globe for thousands of years. Wonder who they are?Because last time i checked the USA has only been around for 242 years while Ethnic Africa has recorded history with their African kings going back 4 thousand give or take. Of course...during those thousands of years Ethnic Africans were all model citizens...right?",1

23128,This is the very definition of shitty pretentiousness,1
23129,Gay ass coon,1
23130,Would somebody please explain why this is popular? I have no idea what the fuck he is saying other than this is America. I like his dancing but I have no idea what the hell the lyrics are. As a song it's pretty pathetic. I think the only reason this is famous is because it's a video with someone shooting people and saying this is America. If this is actually intended to be Hip Hop hip hop has really fallen. Auto-tune and Mumble rap have destroyed Hip Hop,1
23131,What a gay ass song lok,1
23132,"I bet %90 of the views arenÕt from interest in the topic, just from being like Òoh shit Gambino dropped something__Ó",1

I guess I like it when they get down for everybody, but I do understand the reasons...fuck it I guess...keep doing what you're doing homey...this white boy digs it ...#blacklivesmatter",1
23138,The fuck is he doing with his body no offense,1
23139,im so fucking confused now lol,1
23140,"Holy fuck I just realized this too: whenever he pulls out a real gun, nothing is done to stop him, but the minute he fakes a gun with his hand, everyone starts running. Symbolic to the 'cops thought a phone was a gun' stories ?",1

23142,Easier to buy the expensive shit they sell you to keep you distracted vs do what's right and fuck the system. Y'all wanna front and flex though for people who don't care about you instead of elevating yourselves outta control of someone else,1
23143,"Wow! Some thought provoking shit. A lot of people will watch this and not get the message(s) right away but watch it 3 times, at least, and then think. Pay attention to all the shit happening in the background, as Gambino is dancing.  I'm happy that certain artists are using their platform to provoke and challenge the mind of what's going on in our country today. _____________",1
23144,Holy shit what is this!!!!,1
23145,"The video in my perspective is the genocide of Black American Men hence why people were getting shot and he was alone dancing around abandoned cars. The man with the guitar came back to life because he represents music, even though black men are gone, his music still lives. Black men are losing focus on reality and what's happening in the world, or just don't care. They only care about pussy, money, materialistic shit, drugs, and guns (Some black men not all). The dancing and shit represents all the viral videos and dances that we keep looking at and stuck watching everyday. We see that police are killing us and how black men are killing other black people, that we are creating our own genocide in America. We see the situation, but all the other factors that I mentioned before is keeping black men from focusing on it and not care to do something about it. Instead of valuing lives, especially their own, they are valuing other toxic shit. SZA being at the scene of the guy in the guitar and Childish/Donald dancing, represents the black women. After everything is gone in the Black Man's life, she along with his music/culture, are the only things left.......idk I could be wrong or some points maybe off, but your guess is as good as mine lmao.",1

23166,English teachers are gonna analyse the shit outta this in 10 years time,1
23167,What the fuck did I just witness???!!,1
23168,"At what point do people in America realise that the reason school shootings happen isn't because of a gun problem it's because of a people problem, it takes a seriously deranged person to shot and kill a small group of people without remorse, if the main argument against guns is that the same amount of people wouldn't have been killed with knives you need to look at all the facts, if someone wants to kill a large number of people they will do so regardless of the weapons available to them. London had a higher murder rate than New York recently, this is a city in a country with heavy restrictions on guns and yet we still had a higher murder rate than in a city, in a country that does allow guns. It's not the guns that do the killing, it's the people. If the correct mental help is available to everyone without costing someone their entire life savings then I think that school shootings will happen less often, if the media stops reporting on school shootings, they will happen less often. Everyone knows about the Columbine massacre and the people behind it, school shooters, shoot up the schools because they either feel that this is the only way to stop the abuse directed towards them or because they want their name to be out in the world, if people know Eric and Dylan, surely people will hear about the shooter at this random ass school. The shootings may be tragedies but they are tragedies that could have been prevented, not by better gun control but by increasing the support for people with mental health issues, by increasing the amount of support for people being bullied, the guns aren't the issue, the people are the issue, you take away the guns a different weapon will be used.",1

23207,Really shitty song but diggin the theme and message,1
23208,"I'm just blown away by this music video i basically watched it all day yesterday and first thing i did when i got home was watch this a bunch of times.  i still feel like i haven't even come close to absorbing everything this music has to offer.  gambino has great music videos one of my favorite sweatpants the song is just witty and dope And that music video is also a mind fuck but that song is a good time. i feel with, this is America.both times a gun is used they are handled with such delicate care.  makes me think Americans care about guns more than the safety of its citizen. for me how gambino with the amazing backup dancers that fucking killed it with the routine really sucks you in making everything around you sorta disappear makes me think how we just go from horrible killing to horrible mass shootings or the  Anarchy that is going on today or police brutality and nothing ever gets done and we just happily go on with our lives like nothing even happened.  I'd have to say there is so many layers to the video and scenes that I'm not familiar with that i know I'm missing lots of things. i really think this is a masterpiece music video. I'm tripped out I'm so thoroughly into the 2nd season of atlanta and have so much praise for Glover because of how well written that show is.  then Glover does snl killed it and this music video dropped. fucking amazing",1
23209,"Dayum he got one sexy body.Just the right amount of ripped, not like those other unrealistic muscle freaks",1

23217,"This video symbolises that we get distracted with whatÕs been put in front of us instead of the things that really matter. I mean could u keep ur eyes on whatÕs going on in the background and him at the same time.. I know I couldnÕt and thatÕs the problem. Things that should be getting more attention are being thrown at the side and instead new fucking dance moves or clothing styles are being put first... not only America but this is the whole world __. itÕs sad really, but hopefully this video could really open some people minds to the bigger picture...",1
23218,This is so fucking deep itÕs crazy because all over twitter is just making fun of his dancing instead of realizing what this is really about the irony,1
23219,ok now i got it you see a black man killing a whole bunch of other black guys while the song continues the lyrics say everything that black music says so he is trying to make people see the great problem with the black leaders they blame the cops while black man kill  the most black man in America then he goes on to smoke weed which represent the drug culture of the black society of America the dealing and the addiction of it so basically he did a really bold statement even with his cloths he wears a confederation civil war pants which means that he represents the new bondage of drugs and members of the community killing each other and at the end he is chaises by the cops for all the innocent life he took which the black community blames them for all thats wrong while they just the byproduct of the violence in the black society so yeah you have a lot of courage going out and starting to say hey you look at white like they still enslave you while your community kills more of you,1

You have the government ignoring this shit and focusing on things outside of the country, meanwhile police brutality and racism are things that go on every day and are shoved aside because ""there are more important things"" happening. All the chaos that's happening behind the dancing is what is actually happening in our country. There is so much chaos behind the pop culture and sports and TV shows that is getting ignored, and this video is definitely going to bring more awareness to these things.",1
23225,anyone else think doing this type of video would get anyone a ton of attention? put symbolism bull shit in anything and everybody will try to figure it out and find the meaning. dam smart move Gambino,1

23227,"As great of a artistic perspective as this was from a black artist in America, is this gonna change poor urban black American communities from stopping violence within there own communities or within society.  IÕm gonna say no.  That violence has gone on for more than over three decades since I born into this world.  Urban street gang culture is pure evil and is like a disease that says itÕs okay to act like a fool within society because the system is against you and selling drugs to survive is okay and calling women bitches is okay.  Worst abuse of freedom of speech is spreading message of criminal behavior and acting like a thug as sympathetic rallying call for constant bad decision making skills.",1

I'm hispanic and could care less about this. you do realize that black people are the leading killers of blacks? but hey, lets pretend that all of the challenges we face in life are due to a white man even though black people have been free for over a 100 years. Oh....but lets still blame someone else for our problems rather than finding a solution as an individual. Or we can riot and pretend we are making a difference. Create a false organization thats targeted to help black people. I mean....BLM doesn't help with food or charity events. They don't help with school supplies. So who is really hurting who here? Well...I guess we can pretend there is still smoke in the air. For those of you that don't like what I just said (even though everything I stated is truthful) fuck off and get your mind correct!!!",1

23258,The guns are cherished and taken care of after every shooting the so called rap is a mockery of rappers they get paid to teach you bullshit while everything else is going on think about it hard if your black if your white except it for what is is but if you take away weapons from the man they can't control you but if they take them from us we can't protect ourselves. Back in the day only whites had guns that's how easy it was to start slavery,1

23262,i smell wet pussy,1
23263,my fucking man,1
23264,"Ok so IÕm crying right now. I wrote something with deep meaning not about this video, but about our world today. I wrote all 100 something words and as I was typing my phone died. I powered my phone up as fast as I can and when I came back to this video, all of it was gone. I broke down crying, now you might think IÕm stupid and I can already see the comments erupt with comments such as stfu or faggot u probably had nothing good to say, but I assure you I did. I will introduce myself just as I did in my previous comment, My name is Yasmin Alazawi IÕm 13 years old and IÕm 9th grader at my local high school in the Tri-Cities, Washington. Yup thatÕs me. In my previous comment I proceeded to talk about the wars and problems that we previously had and how those all defined us as humans. Us humans, we have two sides, two personalities. We love and we hate, we birth and we kill, we build and we demolish. Notice that all three bad things that I just said, hate, kill, and demolish are all typical things our previous generations did in previous wars. Those are what they chose to do, now we canÕt change our past but we can change our future and how we think of it today. So letÕs talk about how we see it today we probably think our future is hopeless, our technology is only going to get better and somewhere near in the future we would have more than 10 billion people and guess whatÕs the one thing we can do to get rid of people thatÕs right, KILL THEM. ThatÕs our future. But what it didnÕt have to be this way. Now IÕm taking an AP Human Geography class and I have learned things, now the country of Africa currently births the most people. Why? Because the people are poor and canÕt afford birth control. Which is sad and I want to help, not just them but our future generation, so we donÕt end up killing each other off. Our world today is filled with war and hate just like our previous generation. Ending the world wars and slavery was supposed to make everyone look up to a better future, at least for a short time that is. We have essentially gone back to square one but now we have more technology than ever, which guaranties future killing cyber robot thingies. Now I want you to imagine, a place where everyone loves each other, a place where no one has to starve, a world with a booming economy, a place where our children feel loved and appreciated NOT isolated and depressed. Think about that. ItÕs so simple. Our whole life could change with just a switch of thoughts in our brains. We are humans we are made to make mistakes but what good are mistakes when you canÕt learn from them. And donÕt you think we as humans made enough mistakes. ItÕs time for us to solve things, fix things. I am a believer, in a better us, a GREATER us. We could be so much more if we just came together, united as one. And as Martin Luther King Junior once famously said ÒI have a dreamÓ and now IÕm asking you will you make my dream come true?",1
23265,the key to the video is to NOT watch Gambino dancing. focus on the background. this is how america is. focus on simple shit while serious stuff gets thrown in the background... this is America,1

23267,This song fucking sucks,1

23313,"My interpretation of this video as a white dude. I'm in no means right or wrong, so don't get offended or triggered, it's just the messages I got from the video:- From my point of view, I don't believe this video is about guns or gun violence per say; well obviously it does a little bit, but I don't think it's the main focus or message in the video. I think it has more to do with black on black violence and how oblivious people are to it; people don't seem to care that others are being shot up or stabbed in the streets on a daily basis and how little our government, politicians, and the black community are doing to solve it.- Another thing I got out of it was the ""get your money"" part. I thought with all the violence going on in the video that maybe the message was that people would do anything to get money; whether it means commiting crimes, stealing, joining gangs, etc because of how poor and uneducated they are. Like there is a desperation so people feel like the only way to get out of their situation is to commit crimes. - People are more concerned with themselves, whether it's their financial situation or careers or just life ingeneral, instead of caring about the things that are happening to people around them; hinting at how ignorant, arrogant, and close minded people are in our society today.- The distraction of him dancing while everything is going bat shit in the background represents how we only see and hear the perspectives we want to and that are infront of us instead of considering other points of view and looking at the whole picture; kind of like how liberals and conservatives stay in their echochambers instead of exploring other means of information and ideas. - I also think the dancing demonstrates how we put on a face or like try to cover up our problems; making it seem like everything is fine but it's actually not. It seems like they're having a good time but that's all for show, it's not actually how they feel.- A lot of people pointed out that the people singing were church singers; I think they look more like people who are graduting high school or college, looks more like a graduation gown to me which I thought was interesting. Possibly symbolizing that our education system isn't doing enough to protect our youth from violence in and out of school; could also be referring to school shootings and that the victims could have had a bright future ahead of them but it was cut short before even graduating.- We care to much about popular culture (dance moves, viral videos, rap songs, entertainment, celebrities, movies, etc). Also that we are so invested in escapism; living in fantasy lands created on a screen or in our heads instead of living and contributing to the real world we live in and the problems we need to solve.- Also that the kids dancing with Donald were like obsessed with what he was doing and obvious to the things taking place around them. For me it symbolizes how our youth look to pop culture figures as role models, copying and emulating what they do demonstrating how much influence pop culture figures have on the progression of our society and our youth. Also I think it symbolizes that we're always looking at other peoples lives instead of trying to fix and do something about our own.- Another thing I noticed was that the people in the background seemed to be somewhat aware of the shootings and things that are taking place but they aren't really doing anything about it, they're letting things happen which is just escalating the chaos. People are dying and no one seems to care, everything is moving so quickly; symbolizing how we as a society move on from things to fast thus delaying a solution that will stop that stuff from happening again in the future.- Also noticed how the cars were older and kind of beat up; for me it symbolizes poverty. Most of the car doors throughout the video were open like someone broke into them or maybe they were abandoned. There is actually a part around 1:20 were it looks like a dude is looking inside the car and grabbing something then running away. Also noticed people walking and stomping on them.- There are police cars but no police men in the video.- Also notice the gang members on the balcony with their phones filming either themselves or the people dancing. The message I got was that this gang or thug lifestyle is almost like romanticized by our music and media, making people want to he like those dudes with gold teeth and pistols in their hands driving lambos and doing drugs and such.- Noticed death on a white horse. In christianity, white horses symbolize death, but it also symbolizes freedom and power. The message I got was that power is achieved through death; maybe like politicians or people in power want people dying because that helps keep them in power. If there was a solution to violent crime and homicides etc, the politicians won't have an issue to campaign for. So they promise things will be fixed in order to get peoples votes but they never end up doing anything. They say they want to solve these problems and keep people from being killed, but in reality they don't want a solution because the longer they delay the solution the longer they'll be in power, if that makes any sense. Death on a white horse can also symbolize conflicts and wars over seas too, like the enemy needs to die in order to keep your power and influence.- I also noticed how the guns were being treated; set in a towel or whatever after being shot while the person who got shot was just dragged away and how donald just walks away from it like nothing happened. Personally I am a big 2nd amendment supporter and a member of the NRA, but I get the symbolism; caring more about our rights than about peoples lives. I, like many others, want to find ways to solve gun violence without infringing on our rights as americans. People don't realize there isn't a solution that will just magically and automatically get rid of this issue, but a combination of many solutions along with bipartisan agreement in my opinion will help combat and reduce gun violence. If we want to solve these problems, we need conversion and common ground; listening and understanding all of our viewpoints in order to come up with a viable solution that will please and appeal to everyone. Again, these are just the things I got out of the video, not right or wrong, just the things I interpreted and noticed.",1

Finally when the capo finish his emotional problems, the guitar just have to continue spreading the peace hypnosis for the capo to lit a OG and dance while the black magic nigga it's safe, and the hoe that knew what the nigga was doing says ""goodbye"" to us.

America is the freest country that has ever existed. Does he not know that HE IS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ARTISTS/COMEDIANS/ACTORS OF OUR TIME, yet, he still feels as though he, and other black people, are oppressed. Sickening! Also, according to factcheck.org, the majority of the violant crimes are generaly committed by black men (around 52%). And most violent crime against other black people are by other black people. The only reason so many people r praising him for what he is saying, is because that's what is cool to think, because, after all, childish  Gambino thinks it.",1

23369,"This is the truest comment you'll ever read on this video:God damn, that man can dance.  That's not the America I've ever seen, though, and the message is incorrect.  Furthermore, the false analysis seems to be effectively prescriptive.  Meaning, people who put out this message make the world more like the way they claim that it already is.   When you convince people the world is out to get them, you line up for them 3 choices.  1. Surrender unto death.  2. Hide from death.   3. Become more monstrous than the monster; kill everybody first; become the tyrant, so that you, and not they, can live and devour.   It's that third option that is most destructive.  Because the world is NOT that way.  It's NOT necessary.  And telling people that it is, is evil, because it guides them to become evil.  To tell that message is to be the snake.  The world is full of people trying their best to get along, to divide scarce resources in a way that seems fair and just, which doesn't necessarily mean equally; and to protect each other from harm and suffering.   Hysterics, muck-ruckers, and fear-mongers like Antifa and BLM, and the artists who pick up and push that narrative to sell song-and-dance routines are choosing to find anecdotes of failure in the body of humanity, individual cancer cells in the flesh of the giant, by which to teach children to be afraid and to be murderous and neurotic and socio-pathological.    This guy is just a song-and-dance man, and god damn, he can dance.  But like the pied piper leading the rats into the sea to drown, he's leading human children into a life of hate, resentment, and the often resultant criminality that bears a life of being led around from prison cell to prison cell in orange jump suits by other, freer men, fucking each other in the ass, because they never lay eyes on the beauty of woman.  And that's a life like drowning in a sea of rats.   The number one rule of entertainment isn't to tell the truth.  It's to make sure the audience isn't bored.  And that means if the truth is boring, tell them something else.  Don't get your news from entertainers.  This is not the America of my experience; nor of yours, if you're honest.  It's possible I'm misinterpreting his message.  He, like most insinuators, leaves it vague.  But it speaks of betrayal and murder and heartlessness, of blowing away the innocent with a grin.  Based on 5-10 ungenerously interpreted anecdotes over a 20 year period, with which the media ran wild in pursuit of entertainment money, the media is pushing this narrative.  Five to ten out of _hundreds of millions of people_ living their lives.     Even if there are 100 anecdotes upon which this currently fashionable narrative is based, there are over 300 million people in the United States.  So the narrative would be describing the experience of 1 out of 3,000,000 people.  Put it in perspective.   On the other hand, this _narrative_ - that ""This is America"" - leads millions and millions of people to turn off from a mostly-healthy society in resentment and become criminal in their thinking and behavior and to suffer real suffering, the criminal life, the prisoner life.  The narrative does far more harm than the harms it describes, because of the scale.  Millions and millions severely negatively affected, rather than 5-10, or even 100, or even 1000, innocent victims of psychopathy in a vast country.   So I say this to the young, who love music and dance, as I do:  What he shows in the video is NOT america, not even by analogy.  It's NOT what's in store for you.  It's a dark day-dream fantasy.  And if you choose to believe in it, and become dark and terrible to survive, you're being led like a rat to drown in a sea of someone's dark imagination come to life.   That's your choice, and you may be too young to have to make it.  But because entertainers need you not to be bored, you have to make it.   Love the song.  Love the dance.  But reject the narrative, the paradigm, the reality-model, or it will fuck you in the ass until you die crying and bleeding.   (You could be having a BBQ instead, hanging out with friends, talking to the beautiful girl next door, who dressed up though she didn't have to.)  Choose your life.",1
23370,"I hope everything turns out ok one day. Life is being way too full with problems everyday.

I hope all is well to everyone.. I really do.",1
23371,I must admit this is indeed a respectable work of art carrying a profound message but gambino isn't doing/saying anything that hasn't already been said or done by other artist. It's sad because America will only focus on something in 2018 if some rapper or some shit is saying it. Nobody sees that ordinary people have vast wisdom. It takes an idol to get our ears.

No one who doesnÕt play the game is going to beat it. And IÕm sick of the police bs. My father was a policemen for 30 years, heÕs only had 3 co workers in Salinas of all places aka border town for Nortenos and Surenos whoÕve had to fatally shoot. And two of those were white victims. IÕm sick of the giant exaggeration of this ÒAmericaÓ. Most people who fall victim donÕt even try to get out of the toxic environment theyÕre surrounded by. And most say oh but they canÕt because everyoneÕs racist. This isnÕt the god damn 1940s. Racism is fucking illegal when it comes to employment or privilege of any kind. Just mind your own business, focus on your family and education, if you need help ask donÕt just sit in silence but donÕt make it a ridiculous radical message, and if you want to speak out, become someone important which anyone can by working for it.

It puzzles me how this video wasnÕt even on there for AmericaÕs trending videos and now when suddenly it is, itÕs not even #1. At #1 is some stupid Dude Perfect Fortnite video... They try and brainwash us and keep us asleep by hiding what we really need to see. The fact that YouTube and 99% of our media suppliers like news stations or social media is pulling this shit proves the point of this whole video. Donald is giving us an eccentric dancing performance, but when you look closer into whatÕs really going on there is chaos.",1

23461,This is some dumb ass shit,1
23462,WTF is this trash song with dancing faggot nigrow,1
23463,this is scary shit,1
23464,"How is this an amazing song? First of all the actual music is ok at most. The beat isn't super creative or catching and the lyrics aren't the best for the song. Second if this song is good for the political message then this song is still trash. Not only is America not a gun violence distopian society but we also aren't an authoritarian police state yet. The number of mass shootings and police deaths are extremely small compared to the total number of deaths in the US each year they are almost statistically insignificant. Even gun homicides are small for the number of people that die each year. For 2016 around 15,000 people died by gun homicides. In 2015 2,712,630 died. Only 15,000 people died from gun homicide in 2016!! That's such a small number! Furthermore the policies that have lead us to have a more militarized police force has primarily been democratic laws. Both parties have shitted on the American people but Democrats consistently turn out shittier and shittier policies when at least Republicans have some diversity in their mists like libertarians, traditionalists, anti-federalists, etc. America isn't perfect but we aren't in a distopian society like the one depicted in the video. Black people aren't getting mowed down by police and regular people aren't getting mowed down by guns. Also America has made great strives to fix racism. The first African slave was brought to America in 1619. Slavery had existed in Africa for thousands of years and it was black people  who were capturing other black  people and selling them to mostly white people. For years black people were enslaved until in 1865 the 13th amendment was ratified. Throughout slavery free blacks in owned slaves along side white people. The first lifetime ownership of a servant legallyÊsanctionÊby a court was granted to a free black named Anthony Johnson in 1655. Slavery was an institution around the world and black people weren't special to it. After freeing black people from bondage in 1865 America made sure to outlaw it around the world virtually ending cattle slavery. After that racist Democrats created Jim Crow laws that made black people second class citizens. It was not until 1964 after the passage of the Civil Rights Act that black people finally got their full God given rights granted to them. No longer wqs there institutional racism allowed.After the Civil Rights era racism has been eroding from American culture. There are still traces of it but most of it is gone. There is no more institutional racism and most cultural racism is gone.If we want to get all racism to disapeer and then racist bullshit like this video and the movie ""Get Out"" need to go away. People need to be educated of what racism and slavery was and is. Black people didn't experience a speacial kind of bondage. Racism is still happening in North Africa and the Middle East.Overall the song was ok and the political was shit and perverse. Slavery isn't a threat to black people anymore. Black people aren't enslaved anymore and they aren't victims either anymore. They need to start acting like victors and start succeeding in live.During the emacipation era and the civil Rights era black people weren't demanding white people to stop being racist?! They demanded their freedom and success. They didn't shout to white people to stop being racist. Rosa Parks didn't scream at white people to stop being racist and let her in the front of the bus?!! She took it upon herself to gain success and sat at the front! That's a victors mentality that black people are lacking in!",1

23509,"This video enforces juxtaposition as a main theme. It sort of gives the message about how society doesn't hesitate to enjoy and profit off of black culture, but do they wish to acknowledge black struggles? Nope-ity nope. The dancing is one of the main aspects of this video, I feel like the sharp and bold moves are established in a way to mock those who focus on black culture instead of facing and addressing black struggles - especially with the facial expressions they have when dancing, it's like: 'I'm so in to this that I don't want to focus on anything else right now'. That even works because if you look behind the dancing, we are faced with what black people go through on a daily basis. The struggles of police brutality, no gun control, gangs, the law etc. The dancing represents how society wants to engage in things that they can benefit from, AKA, black culture. You can see how the Kardashians and other celebrities are now getting butt implants and lip jobs - I wonder why? They want to profit off of black culture, but have they ever done anything - something - to help black people who face all these challenges and struggles? I think you know the answer to that. The violent scenes in the background contrast with the happy 'mindless' dancing, and focuses on the REAL lives of black people. The message is that we can either choose to close our eyes to black struggles and profit off of them. OR, we can actually do something useful as a society and collectively aim to better the lives of those who are oppressed. Edit: For those saying that this isn't about black culture and struggles, shame on you. Someone in the comments just enlightened me about something really real. 1:49 The BLACK church choir dancing and singing, then they get shot. This instantly refers back to the Dylan Roof event. Where a white idiot went into a BLACK church and killed dozens of black people in order to flaunt some type of 'supremacy' that he thought he had. This.Is.About.Real.Life.ISSUES. And the fact that many are telling me that this music video is about 'partying' and 'being free' makes me see how a lot of you are the 'Dancers' that I was talking about.Idk it's just my analysis, I could be wrong.

Gambino mixing African dance with modern American dance moves is him struggling with his identity as African American.The youth is blind to it as it destroys their community.To cope, you gotta party, dance, and smoke fat joints, until not even that is enough.As soon as the Black (wo)man gets his money, (s)he's chased and hunted. (S)he's marked.There's a lot more, including the empty cop car, to the kids in the rafters filming the chaos from their smartphones, and of course, self medicating to deal with suffering and struggling.And before ignorant as mothefuckers ask what the fuck I know about being Black, my maternal family is Black. I am Black. Like Donald Glover, I'm too light to be Black, and too dark to be White. I dealt with that ""Oreo"" shit, too, as well as being called a kike AND a niggerThis is probably one of the most important and poignant music video in the last 10 years.Gambino will do for Rap what Bowie did for Rock.

God knows the puppets like gambino dont have any word and couldent care less these puppets can buy and sell your whole family in a snap their above the law and dont give a shit about you only about pushing a message to make humans more distant and destroy themselfs. Color is meaningless its nothing but adaptation. Black white brown tan, words used to seperate and control desentralize and decensitize. These messages are 90% nonsence and only meant for the stupid children who have minds filled with close to nothing. You want a good future? For you, your kids, your family,  people who resemble you? Work hard and get a good job and do things as they are meant to be done. Its like the Rebelious dumb kids in school sooner or later their gonna get bit in the ass by reality.",1

23676,"There are so many layers to this. I've seen a handful of analyses, but I feel like some are missing a vital take away that I sense every time I've watched this. To me, this is such a blatant call to action. Notice the students (people dressed in uniform) are always in groups and don't get killed. They are the ones with the tools (celly). They keep coming back, persistent and unified. They are also the successful ones- notice one standing on a car with a bill dispenser (dollar gun). Now you may say the choir is also in a uniform and unified, but they get killed. Could this be a commentary on how religion will not save them? Religion will in fact tear them apart? Glover was born a Jehovah's Witness, but I don't think he practices anymore. I know what you're thinking now, the hooded guy also got shot. Yes, but, he was alone, not unified with anyone, again stressing the need for people coming together, because you may sit around playing inspiring songs on your guitar all day, but if you don't stand up (literally in this video) and team up with others and education yourself, you will fail. I think this is a way for Glover to say here are our problems, let's get our shit together and change the narrative because we will remain in chaos or be persecuted like criminals if we don't. There are holes in this theory, I'm sure. I'm open for civil discussion.",1

Black people are dying out here unjustly, yet you still want to suck on these white devils flat ass. You're pathetic! And to you people that say, ""well black people kill black people too"".

This is horrendously weak and ironically childish within allusions befitting such a pathetic artist. This is their call to uprise? A literary freakshow without an element of grandeur? A lyrical shit show mimicking the same bloodline of nonsensical gibberish? Irony cannot be served this way without due mockery. If this simplistic showing of infantile allusions is their call to band up and dethrone a systematic source of oppression, they've surely never opened their eyes before, nor stricken the vessels seriousness does onto a person.

This song is showing us that there is so much messed up shit in the world but because of the internet we see more memes, viral videos, and viral post than pay attention to the real stuff. We are soo distracted by the funny and cute stuff that we don't even know what is going on. Some the hidden messages include: 17 seconds of silence for the 17 lives lost in the Parkland shooting, The beginning when Donald shot the man the pose he was in represented a Jim crow poster,and when he walked I'm in on the church choir and shot them it resembled the the Texas church shooting. These are just a few of the major things you probaly didn't notice because we payed too much attention to the singing and dancing.",1

23921,this is not on trending. ItÕs bullshit this is a great video and a hardcore view of issues. and for what not kid friendly. Youtube kids is ruining the site. More mature people want to watch more mature stuff not this kids stuff and even channels like sml that look kid friendly are being deleted cause they look kid friendly. Parents u should look before you watch for the mature content watching which sml does have. This is a great and sadly true view of society that kids will not get or want to watch so why remove it.,1

All the popular songs and dance moves is just a distraction, black people will ignore violence and chaos if they ""jam"" come on. Black people ALWAYS talking about Africa, but what has Africa done for you? Drugs, bitches and money, to the black community what else is there? You don't care as long as the black man gets his money, damn everything else. Chaos death destruction, got it imma about to put it on Facebook.",1
23932,Here before Donald trump shit fans,1
23933,True shit,1
23934,"Notice the scene where Donald dances on a car. The guitar player, who represents African roots/culture, now is wearing a bag over his head - you can no longer see his face. Perhaps this represents the loss of African identity in America? Notice as he plays on you stop hearing the African melody.  ""Get your money, black man,"" is chanted, and Donald is dancing his ass off, yet, all he has to show for it is a bunch of outdated cars. Symbolism for how far behind black people are in wealth and progression?",1

23936,"This song is shit, the message is shit, the lyrics are shit, the beat is shit. How does anyone even like this? All it is is trying to explain the ""gun problem"" in America when there is none. Yeah sure most of the libtards grew up hearing ""duuuuuuur guns are bad"" but what I grew up hearing is that the criminals will always get weapons. They are criminals for a reason, they do bad and illegal things. So if you can't stop drugs then what makes you think you can stop guns. Even if you do stop guns there's always another option, you could kill someone with a razor blade, or a car, or a damn pencil. Stop blaming guns for deaths when smoking and overdosing kills more people per year than it. Maybe stop the terrorists who do this shit on a much larger scale, start up the travel ban again and I guarantee things will start going the right way. Guns don't kill people, people kill people.",1

23945,"I love this video.It's interesting how Donald looks and dances so well here and everyone first pay attention to him only.After you watch it few times you understand he is just the distraction for what is happening in the background.This seems to be symbolism for how media and excess of it's consumption pulls peoples attention away from what is actually happening in the world,or in this case America.    I also picked up the weed thing and how he just gets blazed and dances all the shit what happened and nobody is there anymore and the place is abandoned.In the end he runs away with horrified expression on his face, then you notice other people are running behind him,maybe running same direction or chasing him like they are running away from the truth in the end when they realize what is going on,or then they are chasing him for making people actually look, hard to say. Gotta love this.",1

23970,"Okay so I need someone to talk to about this video and dissect this video with me. My entire thought process is around the Òfuture of AmericaÓwith the ÒchildrenÓ.They are just dancing and following behind everything they hear and that is put out... we glorify material things, uplift violence, then act like we are so fuckin hurt when itÕs happening. How can we encourage it and cry about it when itÕs on us? Seriously itÕs like we are so lost and this video captures just that. We are so caught up in whatÕs surface level and things that are lesser matter than human beings but they actually mean more to us now than the actual value of ppl dying on all sides of the board. Promote ignore then as a result more ignorance happens because ppl on both sides donÕt even know wth to think, ItÕs like we see it but we donÕt want to see it. Then listening to the lyrics it sounds as if he is also explaining how we teach the men get the money (by any means now) to get the women and teach the women to worry about being pretty and our bodies (surface level while dying inside) to get the attention of the man ( or the attention of social media) then following behind are impressionable childrenÕs minds that are our future and could be anything, but they will be whatever the world we live in teaches them is right. ________somebody help me gather my thoughts...I am shooketh.

The ending, where he's running away should be the representation of us, the people, not a just a single race, coming together to destroy the bullshit lies were being fed.

We even have a few that we visit and take supplies to & food & fresh water too and just sit & talk. I believe if people could go back to looking at the world through the eyes of children it would be so much better.

However after they understand this, the conversation turns to utter shit with people plagued by small minded ideas. YouÕre too prideful to admit that maybe the organized chaos, you support, endorses these radical ideas of racism and discrimination but I ainÕt just gonna call out them because the mere consequences of generalizing stereotypes of either conservative or liberal cannot let us fucking listen to each other or the message of this video. We literally cannot get anywhere due to the same Ógood and evilÓ fight whoever thinks what role they are.

24052,"ALLLLLrrrrriiiiighhhht. Sooooo, from what I've put together so far, I'm seeing a lot of reference to capitol and financial rape which was mentioned by Martin Luther King Jr, of how racism against blacks was just a symptom of greed of the white upper classmen created to separate the middle and lower class whites and blacks so they wouldn't band together and get even distribution of money like it was supposed to happen back then but was distracted by racial segregation. This was originated all the way back to Jim Crow: a pity cry for the poor white man who deserves better opportunity and more money but the blacks were in the way back then and also a threat to those advantages and gain. I think this music video is a blatant but at the same time inconspicuous jab at how Jim Crow's plan was a success in keeping money from the black Americans, tipping over to the whites, and at the same time letting the rich 1% who engineered racism, keep their money at the same time. If you listen to the lyrics, it's said ""get your money black man"" and another lyric that stood out, ""America, I just checked my following list and you motherf*ckas owe me,"" which is reference to all the money and opportunities kept from black americans that they should've gotten. And if you notice everytime they talked about money in the lyrics something shocking happened and right after, that train of though of ""get your money black man"" was disrupted with ""this is america."" Pretty much making me think that ""this is america"" is more like an excuse of why blacks had their rights taken away and that's just how it was and is, so pretty much ""tough shit"" is what America is saying. Greed and avarice of the rich in charge supported by propaganda pertaining to guns, and every shocking thing you can think of is the main problem of America, and America gets away with it. Racism, sexism, bigotry, ignorance, bias, stereotypical attacks, attacks in general all of it, are derivatives of the upper class of America's greed and they get away with it by distraction: This is America",1

Everyone here agrees that he's mainly hitting on the violence in America and how desensitized people are to it, they record it and ignore it, easily distracted and will completely miss the deeper contents of this book if the cover's nice(His dancing is lively and it's the front cover and people tend to miss the horrible shit happening behind him). But at the same time I think there's more to this video than what we see, which brings me to why I don't like videos like this; they leave no closure. This is a video that leaves people thinking, it doesn't really give you a definitive answer, it's basically handing people a bunch of Lego pieces and it's up to us to put it together how we think it's supposed to be. We have no idea what he really wanted it to be though and I'm not saying that you theories on this message in this video is wrong about the violence and shit, but like I said I think we've only got part of the puzzle.",1

And people disrespect police for doing their job and wether that person did something illegal or not you should comply and then if that cop is being abbusive and throwing you around when you comply, that would be a time to go to legal reasons and say hey I was being nice to this cop and he fucked me up can we have him punished for what he did to me despite my ethnicity, gender or anything else.

24184,Yeoooooo dat nigga stance______,1
24185,This is a bad song. But it has symbolism that dumb people understand so everyone has a boner for it. Saying something doesn't mean you're right for the sake of saying it. Honestly not impressed,1
24186,"The first gun is the only one somebody doesn't toss to him. No idea of what the artistic purpose is, I'm pretty shitty with that stuff but I wonder what the significance of that is",1
24187,"Where did that gun come from, it ain't in his ass at the start",1
24188,"I think what he's trying to convey is that all this violence and stuff keeps happening in America, but ppl just keep creating new fads, dances and stupid shit and don't deal with the violence and crime that keeps happening. Ppl just want to twerk, and YOLO and get faded and stuff like that.",1
24189,"This is America. The safest country in the world with the most opportunity in the world with the most diverse people in the world. With the most freedoms in the world. Life isn't always fair. I was raised poor, joined the military and then worked my ass off at shit jobs until I made something of my self. That is America.",1
24190,0:52 when you finally found the guy talking shit on Facebook.,1
24191,Wakanda shit is this,1
24192,"Watched this early in the morning, scared the shit out of me. IÕm guessing that was the effect they were going for",1
24193,I can fucking hear migos and 21 savage in this video idkw,1

24195,Welcome to the US fucking A,1
24196,"Random normal shit for about 45 seconds, then what the fuck at about 49 seconds. This is Childish Gambino.",1
24197,dope ass song __,1
24198,I wish that as soon as he pulled out the joint a bunch of police would have starred shooting. That would be s real commentary on how America will ignore all the violence and act like everything's fine (like through out the video) but they will crack down on petty drug use. Because why would we use our police to track down murderers and rapist when the real criminals are the ones smoking weed__,1
24199,wtf is this nigger shit,1
24200,"#1 trending in Canada.   Loved the beginning, starts off reeeal nice as I love the African vibes, but then after the first shot, I was damnnnnn shit just got real up in here.  I love how real it is, sad that we are still fighting a war within our own Countries in 2018 with racism.",1
24201,"This is amazing. Every time I watch I see more, feel more, ask more... this is fucking brilliant",1

24206,How did flakka abusing motherfucker inspire people?,1
24207,"IÔm livin in austria and iÔm 19 years old and still it just bothers me that, no matter what happens so many people just turn away at so many things.. things that are happening right in front of their fuckin nose and still some of those douchbags out there they only care about :ÒwhoÔs the next guy or kid or woman gettin killed somewhere ?Ò or :Òwhen will we see the next guy gettin shot from cops in his car bc of nothin ?!Ò I think iÔm the same with you all here in these comments.. youÔre all right and you have your different opinions and minds and thatÕs good but couldnÔt we all just really think about all that shit thatÔs happening out there and not just sit around and do nothing for an eternity or search some kind of an exit in our lives that we donÔt have to confront ourselves with such problems?.. if someone wants to do something equally to that then please do it your welcome but then youÔre actually just showing off that youÔre a spineless pussy",1
24208,Wtf is this shit,1
24209,I watched this shit 6 times in a row.  Most thought provoking rap video released in at least the last decade.  Just encapsulates some of the greatest flaws in our society right now in such a shocking and in your face way even in it's subtleties it's just astounding.,1
24210,Illuminati puppet that took it up the ass confirmed.,1
24211,0:51 if i kill a pussy ass nigga I'mma make it look sexy,1
24212,"I think this video is just about how  we are all shocked in the first place by one shot and then quickly lose that thought because of the happy dancing. Just like how a black man is killed in america and we are all shocked but two Hours later everybody is distracted by Kanye saying something like slavery is a choice . I also noticed how everything Seems good if you just look at the video (not counting the two shootings) but if you look again , you can see crazy shit in the background like somebody comitting suicide. And that currently is america two shootings happen and everybody loses their shit before quickly Being distracted by something else like dancing. All this while there are riots in the background that nobody Sees unless you pay attention to it. Thanks for Reading this guy number 1 and guy number 2",1
24213,The song fucking sucks,1
24214,what the fuck did i just watch,1
24215,what the fuck did i just watch,1
24216,This song is a punch to brain. Pretty fucking amazing piece of art right here.,1
24217,WTF is this shit? weird fucking song,1
24218,Yea this is america...all you fucking retards listening to shit brainwashed music like this and worshipping rappers and Hollywood movie star puppets. You dumb fucks. This  video is cancer.,1

24221,21 savage and Thugga on this bitch ____,1
24222,Im kinda pissed that sza didnt sing  but great ass song and this video __,1
24223,"2:45 Is that the, ""I've never properly shot, or actually shot, a handgun before"" stance?  I feel where you're coming from but seems like more leftist bullshit for real.  We can blame so many other things.",1

24226,"This guy is brightHis dance is a distractionReal shit in the back______",1
24227,So many fuckers just commenting shit thatÕs been explained 50 times to sound smart just stfu and listen to the fucking song you thots,1
24228,This shit goes too hard,1
24229,I donÕt get the hype behind this video at all. ItÕs sort of a Black Panther effect? Everyone is so excited for Òblack artÓ all of a sudden when itÕs something poppy and unchallenging. ItÕs why people acted like Black Panther was the best thing since MLK when Moonlight came out THE YEAR BEFORE AND WON BEST PICTURE. Just like how all of a sudden people are excited about this but nobody gives a fuck about any of the music videos from TPAB (alright/ for free?),1
24230,"Looks like he is telling yall that U.S. citizens are ready to go into fema facilities and thats why the video is shot in a place like this... and  you also have chaos going on all behind him... sounds like how martial law will be when they shut the so called government down,  and see the  pale horse? Shout out to William Cooper. Gambino is telling yall through the music indirectly. You got to have your pineal glad open to see how he is communicating. This shit in movies and music is nothing new... got to have a mind of a magi to figure it out.",1
24231,what the nigger fuck,1
24232,44M In 3 days? ThatÕs fucking insane,1
24233,"Everyone has been talking about this video. No exaggeration here. This video even made it into the news. So I came just to see what the hell everyone was talking about. I have heard of Childish Gambino but never listened to him until this song. Needless to say, I'm fucking speechless. *Speechless.* The imagery and the message behind it gives me chills! I love it.",1
24234,"there's definitely a harsh criticism of america in this video but at the same time i feel like theres an optimistic view that us americans can still smile, dance and party no matter what fucked up thing happens. for better or worse its the fuckin truth.",1
24235,Can people stop being so toxic and enjoy a fucking song? Jesus christ yeah there is political statements in the video but dont act like this is some civil rights movement.,1
24236,1 like=1 ass whooping,1
24237,Bet this nigga thought he looked like mj with those dance moves,1
24238,Hate that choppy lazy ass hyper-ebonics style of present day hip hop.  So fucking trendy. Hip hop peaked in the late 80s and early 90s hands down.  Been going downhill ever since.  You copied the style of today.  Not original at all.,1
24239,Am I the only one who thinks this song sucks ass,1
24240,The fact that niggas is talking about Kanye West on this video proves that we just love to destroy each other. It also proves that y'all are sheep because I guarantee you weren't fucking with Gambino but all of a sudden he drops some dumb ass song about him shitting on America and y'all his biggest fans.,1
24241,He looks like fucking Reggie Watts on 0:39 what the fuck,1
24242,Is everybody fucking blind or something? Tf?,1

24353,"Everyone talking about symbolic meaning in video. But none of them point it out.Here ill do you one. The video itself shows cop cars in the background but there empty. Then followed by a bunch of people rioting. Pointing out that people just use cops as a scape goat to do all types of fucked up shit when cops usually dont have shit to do with the current situation. The second meaning is that the cop cars might be there but the cops might as well not be cause alot of them dont do shit. And there is a stupid amount of other shit in thr video.",1

24373,I fucking love donald,1
24374,MY INTERPRETATION IS So him dancing while everything is going on behind him is a message saying that as humans we get distracted so easily by media and entertainment we donÕt take time to pay attention to the shit around us,1
24375,This is on some Kendrick shit,1
24376,Jerry no matter how much you try to distract us. You still shit in class.,1

24381,This nigga body so weird looking,1
24382,fucking dope,1
24383,"you can take this how ever you'd like but to me this is about how america has allowed senseless killings to become the norm, everyone focuses on money fame, attention, and expensive shit and the moment a shooting happens most react by saying something like ""well that was fuck but that's not my problem""  While some want change for about a week or two but then the newest trend comes out and everyone follows, we move on happy and unconcerned it seems like nothing ever really changes and this is america now, were here for a good time not a long time right? oh well everyone's view point is different....",1

24385,video and beat are good lyrics suck tho,1
24386,The gangsta and faggot in one body. Him running at end is the consequences he will get for making this videos by white bigots,1
24387,"It took me a couple of times to get my point of view on this music video. I feel as though when he shot the guy then dances then shoots up the church and goes back to dancing,  heÕs throwing reality at us. Peep how when you go on the explore page, the kids are doing the ÒshootÓ dance (where they kick their feet and pump their arm)! Are we being told to shoot? Are the rappers promoting us to shoot? Here are a few lines from the ÒShootÓ song, ÒClip hanging out the Glock, extendoHomicide, bitch we known for thatÒThink about it now. WeÕre being distracted from whatÕs going on in America with dances and gifs and social media. And when the kids on the upper level had their phones out, they also have their mouths tied up! Basically showing us that phones and technology are stopping the kids from speaking up or just being able to socialize without a phone. And at the end when he just runs and everyone is chasing him, you gotta really look and notice that you see no colored faces chasing him. Why is he running? Because heÕs black? Is it because since they see us rapping these songs about murder and drugs and dancing to song saying Òshoot shoot shoot Ò we instantly feel guilty when we see the cops? Or is he running from reality? Is he scared to face the fact that he has the power to make a change? Or idk IÕm probably waaaay off, but thatÕs what IÕm thinking after watching 5 times... IÕm going to watch it like 10 more times and come back with a updated theory .",1
24388,I fucking love it ! ___,1
24389,IÕm in hell right now and this shit hotter than the fire down here bruh,1
24390,at 0:44 when the light hit him he started pumping his chest that shows strength and the light represents the public and how other countries and society used to view it as the greatest country in the world and then all the shitty stuff happened after that in the video,1
24391,What the fuck is this?,1
24392,"Notice how - at the beginning - there is chaos in the back, but as soon as he smokes, the hall is empty and the sun is shining through the roof. And at the end all the shit is coming back at him, with the people running after him, saying you can't escape the shit that is going on in this world.",1

Today's music lyric are trash and Gambino is absolutely correct. Gun violence, kids too busy with social media without being aware what is happening surround them. Notice everytime he shot someone, they took care of the gun with care and ignored the victims. All the dancing and dumb lyric is just to distract the audience, pay close attention to the background.  This song is portraying our modern day America. Good but sadly true message in my opinion.",1

24656,"An Explanation of the video (From beginning to End):He's wearing confederacy pants through the entire video. The confederacy represents racism and the oppression of Blacks through slavery. He kills a barefoot music player in the beginning, changing the video's tone and signifying the murder of the negro spirit (which embodies the innocence and the civility of the black community). The background shifts to chaos and panic (a riot, as you can see police in riot gear in the background) in reaction to the murder of the negro spirit. This is similar to modern society as in recent years when blacks are unjustly murdered in light of racism by figures of authority, the black community riots. The kids in school uniform represent the youth in the black community and the youth in America as a whole. They are concerned with fun (represented by them dancing), and materialism (as you'll see a kid in the background standing on a car shooting money) that they turn a blind eye to what is happening around them. Relative to real life, you'll notice this in the comment section, as a majority of young viewers are ignoring the message to talk about how the song is a banger. It then cuts to a choir singing, Gambino walks past them and dances in a sense of mockery and adoration, before he kills them. Him killing the Choir is a reference to Dylan Roof murdering Blacks in a Charleston Church. And once again, the video shifts to people rioting. In the background, you'll see police now combating the riots, and even more chaos ensues. You can also see one of the kids in a school uniform jump from the balcony and commit suicide. This suicide is a reference to how Suicide is ignored in the Black community (because the rest of the kids still dance and ignore the suicide), and it can be seen as how in America youth are increasingly depressed and committing suicide. The video then pans upwards to kids on the balcony recording the chaos on their phones and doing nothing to intervene. This shot is a reference to modern society in which people record everything that happens in their lives, even scenes of chaos. A good example would be how the younger generation record fights, or how shootings are recorded on handheld phones (I'm sure there are better examples, but you get the point). As the chaos ensues, you see a guy on a white horse riding in the background. This is a biblical reference to the Apocalypse, as one of the four horsemen of apocalypse rode in on a white horse. Granted that the white horse has various interpretations, however relative to this video, it clearly signifies Apocalypse and the chaos going on in the video. The video then goes silent, as he's in a gun pointing position. I found this profoundly interesting as you then see the kids freak out, and run away (you also hear a scream), followed by 17 seconds of silence. This is a reference to the recent Parkland High school shooting, as there were 17 people killed in the recent tragedy. After the silence, you see the representation of the negro spirit again (still masked as if he'd never been shot). There is no chaos, there is no rioting. Gambino walks on top of a car, and dances. You also see a Black woman (artist SZA), gawking at the camera and Gambino. I believe that this embodies the success that Blacks could have experience had the negro spirit murdered. The scene is symbolic of black success. At the very end of the video, you see Gambino running away from White people. Prior to being chased, Gambino was successful. Despite making it through the chaos, and becoming successful, Gambino is now getting chased by whites. This symbolizes the struggle of a successful black man, as despite being successful and making it out of the chaos of being black in America, they are still (more so directly now) being hunted and chased by whites. No matter how much money a black person has, they still are seen as Black. Their success, must be kept down in America. Throughout the video, you'll also notice that after Gambino shoots people, he gives his gun to one of the kids to hold on to and keep safe in a red cloth. This symbolizes the reverence of guns in America. It symbolizes that guns are so important in America that we pamper them and entrust our children with their handling.Gambino's character in this video had two different identities, and played two different roles in this video. When Gambino was shooting blacks, his character represented Black on Black crime (given that Gambino is black), and it represented the racial oppressors of America and American history (given that he's wearing confederacy pants). Gambino's character dancing in the video represents the famed racist character of Jim Crow (as his movements appeared as a mockery of blacks in some cases), as well as the ignorance blacks show to their own social issues (as he was dancing to the beat, despite the chaos going on around him). The duality of Gambino's character represents the duality in the nature of social issues. There is no wrong or right side to the social discourse we experience in America. Gambino's character is a combination of Jim Crow, and Uncle Tom. The racism and injustice that blacks face are sometimes self inflicted within our community. Other times, America fucks us over and the historical oppressors (whites) are the reason for our suffering. Some of you look at this video and simply write it off as a Black Problem, as if Blacks are second class citizens. Given that there is more White on White crime, than Black on Black crime, I think you may want to readjust your ""Superior Race"" mentality. Many of the issues presented in this video were historically caused by the systematic racist tendencies of America. Try acknowledging the faults of your forefathers, and the benefits you reap by them as opposed to labeling everything a ""Black issue"". I understand that you are not cultured enough to understand our struggle, but when we present it to you in a way that'll make you think and you ignore it, it seems more so like an American problem as a whole, given the miscommunication. The title of the video is ""This is America"". The song is self-explanatory, and sounds the way it does to convey a simple message to an audience in which majority don't like to use their brains. The name of the video isn't ""This is Black America"". The name of the video isn't ""This is White America"". The video explicitly presents commentary on America as a whole. The issues we face are universal. There is no superior race. We are a melting pot of social injustice, and race inequality. This is America.",1

24703,"My thoughts on the Childish Gambino video for the song ÒThis Is AmericaÓ... tell me what yÕall think... 1. The video is set in a warehouse: the definition of a warehouse is- a large building where raw materials or manufactured goods may be stored before their export or distribution for sale. 2. In the warehouse, in walks a black man who sits at a chair and plays a guitar with African inspired chants/music plays in the background. This man and the music represents the roots of black music in its most rare untainted form. 3. Childish Gambino starts dancing to the lyrics ÒWe just want to party/Party just for you/We just want the money/Money just for youÓ. His eyes bulging, facial expressions and dance moves are all reminiscent of a minstrel show performer. *In this scene he represents the new black artists(hip hop in particular- You can hear adlibs from some of todayÕs popular rappers throughout the song.)* Childish dances up to the man with the guitar-who no longer has the guitar-who now has a cloth bag over his head like a hostage victim. Childish pulls out a gun and shoots the man in his head. He then hands the gun off to a kid dressed in a school uniform. *This represents how the roots and soul of black music has been taken hostage and killed by coons out to make a dollar. And this violent image of blackness is being manufactured and sold to the world (including our own youth).* After the shot rings out Childish raps the lyrics ÒThis is AmericaÓ. 4. Childish then begins to rap and dance again- now with a group of black kids in school uniforms. There is chaos happening in the background (people running around with guns, bats, throwing money ...etc)-but the dancing continues... 5. A gospel choir joyfully sings the lyrics ÒGo and tell somebody/Grandma told me/ Get your money/ Black man get your moneyÓ Childish still dancing, pauses to catch an automatic weapon in his hands, then unleashes fire on the singing choir. *This represents the Charleston massacre.* After firing, he raps the lyrics ÒThis is AmericaÓ. 6. The chaos happening in the background is building into a riot (smoke, police cars, cars on fire...etc) Childish and the kids continue to dance as if nothing is happening. *This represents how too many black hip hop artist are ignoring the current state of their people, they are too busy chasing money and selling a destructive image to our youth...It also shows how the world is dancing to our music and enjoying our culture, but will still murder us and not bat one eye.* 7. Kids with their faces covered catching the riot or murders on their phones. Also there was the rider of the white horse whoÕs face was covered. *This couldÕve represented the KKK or the ÒWhite Rider of the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse.* 8.  Then the music stops and the kids all run away. Childish is frozen in place like he is in a deep sleep. Then he awakens, lights a joint, then the music starts again. *He has an epiphany * 9. Childish then says ÒAmerica, I just checked my following list and YOU MOTHAFUCKAS OWE ME!...Get your money black manÓ *This could be a reference to reparations or money owed to black artists in general -or both* 10. Childish then climbs on top of a car and starts dancing (reminiscent of Michael Jackson dancing on a car during his trial-and issues with Sony) with the lyrics ÒBlack man get your moneyÓ(*reparations*) repeating over and over... 11. The Black man he shot at the beginning is still alive, and still playing his guitar. But his head is still covered *The soul of black music didnÕt die, itÕs still being held hostage, but there is still hope.*  12. The camera cuts to a new scene with a new song. In the scene Childish is running for his life. He is being chased by a mob of people,but their faces are blurred out. It looks like the mob has people of all races and genders chasing after him, but again they are blurred... *Im not too sure what to make of this scene, except maybe once you Ôwake upÕ and know your worth and your peopleÕs worth you will be attacked-from all sides...IDK*....The lyrics to the new song are ÒYou just a black man in this world/ You just a barcode,aye/ You just a Black man in this world/ Drivin expensive foreigns, aye/ You just a big dawg, yeah/ I kenneled him in the backyard/ No probably ainÕt life to a dog/ For a big dogI think this video is pretty genius myself...Tell me what yÕall think? Do you agree with my assessment or nah? Did I miss anything? Let me know...",1

24713,"If anybody is wondering what the video means, here is one interpretation:In so many words, silly dancing and buzzwords distract us from the messed up shit happening in America.  Donald Glover and his dancers stay in focus in the foreground, while riots, police brutality, and corruption happen out of focus on the periphery of the public's vision.  Every now and then something happens that lets us focus on the senseless cruelty and systemic racism happening here, like when Donald shoots the man with a bag over his head or kills that church choir, but then it's right back to silly dancing, and the civil discourse has become out of focus once again.  It doesn't mean it isn't happening, it means the noise machine of our constant desire to be entertained and distracted is drowning out real life, and real life is looking like a daily dumpster fire because we allow ourselves to become complacent and distracted like children enamored with jangling keys.  We're obsessed with fiction at the expense of reality.",1

24723,"Anyone notice that the kids are with Donald Clover throughout the majority of the video but at the end when he's running, they aren't near him. It's almost conveying that kids nowadays are quick to follow and idolize celebrities yet when shit gets real, these celebrities won't think twice about the children and they would leave them behind to die in the mess that they (the celebrities) have created. Also notice how the whenever Donald Clover shot somebody there was always someone there to collect the gun, almost protect it. (We know how much America loves their guns) yet when Donald pulled out an invisible gun people are quick to run and they are scared of the black man not the gun. Reminds me of the black children and adults who have died because someone had called the police on them as they believed had been holding a gun when it was actually a toy car or something.",1

I just recently started cutting back on my social media and I feel like ten thousands pounds of baggage have dropped off my back. I feel like I have so much more time to learn, to grow, to listen to what's happening in America and the world and find ways that I can help make the world a better place. I've even learned how many people throw in propaganda in social media and feed us false information to get us talking about the wrong things. It's projected that 30% of the twitter profiles are bots, not humans BOTS. You could literally be arguing with a bot and not even know it. What else are people trying to do through social media? Or music videos? So many music videos are about drugs, sex and money. What is that doing to us? Even though we might not like the words but ""stay for the beat"", how are the words affecting our subconscious? How is our mindset changing? Are we beginning to emulate these people who advocate drugs, sex, money over the people like Donald Glover who make us consider our present day America? Every day so many people, companies, social media platforms compete for our attention for their own agenda, who will win? Where will we put our precious time towards each day?",1

Those people then go to the internet to have debates over what they believe is the true meaning of the video, thus providing free promotion which was the videos purpose the entire time. We'll then see articles like ""The new Childish Gambino video has Twitter in an uproar! It's the most talked about video of the year!""Although it's clear this particular video's theme is black crime, the marketing technique is no different than those used in videos by Beyonce, Rihanna, or Kesha where occult imagery is embeded throughout the video.Instead of ""Oh, shit! You see how Rihanna is covering one eye? That's illuminati shit!"" ""Yo, yo. Rewind it. You see how Beyonce's eye is twitching? That's MK Ultra shit! She's trying to break free, but she can't!""This time it's ""Yo, you see how he's standing? That's Jim Crow shit!"" ""You see the kids streaming everything on their cellphones? He's trying to redpill us on the dangers of social media!"" ""Nah, son. He's trying to tell us that all black lives have been in danger since Trump took office!""This Childish Gambino video is the same music industry bullshit that's been used over and over again because they know it works every time.",1
24904,Wtf is this gay shit,1
24905,"In contemporary society we glorify the idea of Òblack cultureÓ which is fine to an extent, but what we fail to acknowledge is that black culture coincides with oppressive social issues.  We focus so closely on parts of their culture that we believe are cool, failing to acknowledge the horrific burdens and hardships that accompany that.  WeÕll listen happily to a song about fuggin bitches and getting money or learn new dances and shit, but when it gets down to the heart of their culture we push it away.  We pick and choose what we like from black culture, but one word about gun violence or police brutality we turn away and fail to make the distinction that these things are embedded in that culture and must be acknowledged.  TheyÕre truly dancing in the chaos while we watch, often to our amusement. This message wants reception on all ends on the racial spectrum.  This video isnÕt a shot at a single race, itÕs a nuclear fucking bomb.  WeÕre all getting hit.",1

He is showing us, that there are so much going on in the world, by the people in the back ground, stealing, killing each other, selling drugs, and more, but if you notice Danny is doing all the latest dancing which tells me, that he saying we all know the latest dance and music, but are clueless to the shit that is really taking place in the world...

How else are innocent people supposed to protect themselves from violent criminals?  If gun violence is such a problem then why are Detroit and Chicago dying from black on black violence?  The problem isn't the guns, it's the bullshit thug culture that these people are brought up to admire. If you want change in the world then start with yourself, but don't push your beliefs onto the innocent ones, we need protection from the very people that cry out racism in order to achieve more false privilege.  Not to mention that this video displays all kinds of demonic imagery, the very opposite of what this dude's trying to convey, or is he?  Do yourself a favor and don't follow this kind of garbage, it's used to drive a wedge into the population in order to infect us with subliminal divide and conquer tactics.

25005,In America (which where I live) we eat with gun magazines and me drink oil in our cereal and the cash comes from the sky. Also you talk shit you get gunned down bitch,1
25006,"For anyone confused on the hidden messages in the video. Here you go: he talks about gun control, the Florida shooting, how America cares more about guns than human lifeÕs, and how America focuses on the non important things on social media and life rather than the important (reason as to why he put all the chaos in the background, more people focus on gambinos dancing rather than the people falling from a building.) and black discrimination. As the camera scans over the 4 people sitting on the ledge of the building he says Òthat is a toolÓ meaning that is a gun, but really they were phones, heÕs basically saying police mistake guns for phones ALL the time, and kill innocent people who did nothing wrong. I seen an interview where the interviewer asked him what the video was about and he refused to answer, because the reason as to why he made this was not to explain it, it was to put this story out there, to let people find it out on there own, because once he says what itÕs about itÕs not as meaningful ya know? If you do the research yourself and actually really look at the background the whole time, youÕll see the shit that really does happen in our society today, itÕs sad, but with more people explain things like this, we will make America better than it ever has, without the help of Trumps dirty ass.",1
25007,at 1:05 I think he's referring to Micheal Jackson thriller ... this shit is deep,1
25008,"Yo this song has no feeling to it. It sounds like a bad mix of sounds put up all together and odd lyrics that attempt to give a message that only the normies can understand. I literally can't understand what he's saying besides this is America and ""I gotta carry them"". The visuals are the only good things about this video. Solid ass dance moves too. Also , just to mention, you become what you resist the most. That goes to all of you who keep on saying, I'm not a racist. You'll eventually become one to an extent .",1

25168,"It's a little depressing to see a music video so clearly preaching that we should stop glorifying violence and we should try to understand each other better but I see so many people in the comments pretending like only black people are getting fucked right now, life in the states is shit for everybody now. Everybody is throwing out stats about black on black violence and the black suicide rate but those aren't only black problems it has nothing to do with race and everything to do with peoples socio-economic standing, you guys really think it's any worse being a dirt-poor black kid living with your 5 siblings and single mom than if it was the same situation and you were white/Mexican/purple? If you truly do at best you're deluded into thinking there's some magic benefit that comes with being white or you lucky enough to grow up in a situation where you didn't have to worry about money at all, so you assume every white person doesn't have too either. I understand a lot of peoples comments here and I, like a lot of people in the US have never seen that kind of racism first hand so yes I couldn't possibly understand what it's like to go through but I can understand what it's like to spend my whole childhood hoping that we could make rent that month or that we could have enough food to feed the family or that god forbid one of us would get sick. The point I'm making is that yes this is an important video to bring issues that the black community faces to the light but to use a video like this as a cudgel to tell other races their issues in day to day life in America aren't as important is going entirely against the point Childish Gambino was trying to make, life in this country is shit for us all we should unite under that fact not try to tear out eachothers throats trying to prove who's the bigger victim when we could be fixing our shithole.",1

America may look all neat and fun like everyoneÕs having a good time with all the trends and bullshit, but its a really a distraction to mask whats really going on within the country. shootings, panicking and mayhem.

Just another ""woke"" crap entertainment. Yeah, he thinks we are distracted by violence in this country through lowly entertainment and throws in some shit about police brutality. All of this you can read on Huffington Post or grab from the BLM site. You're not ""woke"" nor are you smart for getting any of this.

25223,Look at all these dick riders,1
25224,"Alright... I wasn't gonna give my thesis but here it is...And this is to me, my opinion, as what I translated.This is the way America is these days. He's way more lyrical than this but notice he stuck to repeating the same 3 words as if that's actual entertainment or hard to do? He's making fun of the fact that rap these days has turned into a bunch of mumbling ass hats. Then he shows how America celebrates it. Then he's also talking about ""Get your money black man"" but notice when the camera pans back its a bunch of old cars? I think that represents the facade that rappers put on. Behind the scenes, they aren't working with as much money as they want you to believe. The killing of the innocent people, like the guitar player and the choir, represents good music that we are killing,  throwing away or dismissing, only to celebrate ignorant trash music. Also, the slayings catch you off guard, but then just like life, after the horrific killings, we go right back to celebrating dumb shit. Then the  end of the music video, it shows that no matter how much they celebrate you for doing what you're doing, they will eventually turn on you,  savagely. To me, ""This Is America"" is a great way to see America from the point of view of a non-American. Very brilliant.",1

All have black prejudice, and murder, only no one is talking about the fact that blacks much more likely statistically to commit crimes than whites.But these statistics are racist, so we're not going to solve socio-economic problems and to resolve the issue of the black ghetto (even in the country-city ghettos is due to economic flop, where the eateries are bulletproof, bitch).Instead, we will cultivate reactionary theses in society: cops, bitches, don't work, kill unarmed black people all the time (forget that they kill exactly the same white people more often, for some reason the reactants did not discuss so much the case when a white drunk guy was forced to crawl on the carpet, and then shot because he tried to pull his pants, it's not as important as killing a black guy!), society likes weapons, what horror.",1

The lyricism is extremely juvenile, exploitative and shallow. It's trying to be a banger while at the same time imparting some sort of wisdom, but with the generalized, and amateurish lyricism falls completely short of. It's like Childish Gambino had the idea to talk about important things in the black community, but went super soft with the concept of his flow and verses within the final product. But the beat alright, so instead they just added some shock value images to keep the audience hypnotized while trite lyrics are being rapped over and decent sound. And finally the lyrics are so generalized and shallow they could apply to anyone living in a shitty situation, not even necessarily black people, but he dresses it up in, for lack of a better term, black face to really sell that exploitation of the community on a bare minimum of poetic thought. I can't respect this dude for this. But I do understand how people not ready, or not trying to find deeper meaning in something, or someone who desperately trying to find meaning in something think that this is genius, because it really isn't. I see it as very flavor of the week unfortunately. This video didn't leave me shook or none of that, but BOOGIE's did.So let's take a look at BOOGIE's lyrics for NIGGA NEEDS:[Intro]Yeah, yeah, uhI need to learn commitment, woahI need to quit my joking, yeahI need a boat of bitches, uhI swear my mind been floating, mmAin't tryna fuck this bread up, noI need to get more focused, yeahI need to smoke forever, yeahI need to save my roaches, uh[Verse]Talking empty homes with the fridge in itTalking juice cartons with the sip in itTalking ham sandwich with the chips in it, I admit niggaI'm a food stamp popping, white tee rockingSwap meet shopping, Instagram watchingDM hopping, niggas know the dealNow they know I got it, now they know I got it, wooI used to be so humble, whoa, I need to call my momma, yeahI need to get my girl back, uh, I need to weigh my options, yeahSaying Godsend to a moshpitTalking young niggas with the nonsenseThat's Capri-Suns with the hot chips, then the plot twistsFrom a Gameboy playing, sidekick aimingChurch boy singing, Westside bangingGirlfriend taking, niggas know the dealI ain't gotta say, it I ain't gotta say it, noI need a rap nigga just to mention me, I'ma finish himKeep it industry, just don't intervene with my nigga needsWhat a nigga need is a lot, I need a bunch of new fansJust so I can go say that I popped, say that I poppedI need for y'all to stop tryna compare me to niggas I'm notCos really I'm not, I need to stop using UberAnd go take my ass to the lot, straight to the lotThe homie just offered a brick, I'm like fuck it I'm taking my shotI'm taking my shot[Bridge]I need to find my balance, uhI need to fix my vision, yeahI need to find new content, uhI can't keep downing women, noI'm a Nike slipper wearingSweatpants thugging, once a year clubbingHomegirl fucking, homeboy pluggingLong as niggas hustling, I ain't saying nothing no, no no[Chorus: Boogie + Dana Williams]No, I need something that's gon make me feel for real insideFor real inside, aw yeah, uhNo no, no I need something that's gon heal my prideTo heal my pride, aw yeah, uhNo I need something to make me feel a certain wayMake me feel a certain way, a certain wayNo I need something to make me feel a certain wayMake me feel a certain way, a certain waySo within the intro he has already established his contradictory mind-state, which is showing humility within his lyricism, while also showing the duality of what a black man in his position needs vs what he wants. He establishes the struggle within himself.Within the first verse he paints the picture of his living environment, of what it means to be living in the hood, with very few options, and the meager settings and necessities he has to get by. Not only does he set the mood and the world he's living in, but he fully embraces that he is a product of that environment. He highlights that his plight is one that is very fickle, like walking a type rope line. He makes it a point to tell the audience that he needs their ears and acceptance to better himself. If his peers and community don't support him then he has to take his shot selling drugs. So in the same breath he's talking about being accepted by a community that is just as disenfranchised as he is, but trying to elevate himself, by elevate his community with truth, but if the community is ready to see itself for what it is and change, he can not lift himself out of impoverishment with his community thus making both better. Both he and his community are interdependent on one another's success. That's the second the verse.Then the bridge of the song moves toward where he currently is in life, the thing's he knows have to get done, and the things he is. The dichotomy of doing what's best and what's best in that moment. The struggle.And then you get to the chorus and it's all the secret pain he, or the black person who identifies with the lyrics, internalizes and tries to keep hidden. He hides his feelings like a snitch hides the truth.The entire song is genius, and heart breaking, and it ain't no club banger at all. It's not trying to move your body, which this song does. NIGGA NEEDS really tries to move your mind, which brings me the music video.T MV tops this one, because the warehouse used in this video is supposed be be giving the same effect as BOOGIE's art gallery exhibit.",1
25338,While we are all distracted by all the shit we see and listen to on the internet music dancing anything that gets our attention distracts us from what's really going on in Americans the world you are just watching him dance but don't see the shit goikng on behind him,1

The first one, and most obvious is to watch Childlish Gambino dance moves and great song, distracting you from what is really happening in America, just like Reality Shows, shit music, fake news, murders, shootings, etc. The other way is to completely ignore Gambino and see the reality out there. Amazing video.",1
25350,Whoever disliked this video is a very dumb person and has bad taste in music itÕs fuckin amazing this mans the boss,1
25351,sjw shit,1
25352,This video is deep. He talks about society and how it's fucked up. He's showing us how easily we can get distracted from the important issues. And shows us some of the important issues America faces. He shows police being hated. Murder. People that don't care. People that only care about money. Thievery. (I don't support gun ban) but he shows how a fully automatic can take out a lot more people than the concealed pistol could. He shows how weed creates peace. He showed himself (us) running away from society (and the truth) Good fucking video man!,1

25366,"Happy that rap is returning to its roots, as a way to speak to social injustice, as it was in the early 80's. Instead of big booty hoes , pussy and fucking whatever bullshit.

25369,"Its our violent culture as Americans that is plaguing our society. This music video is referencing how in our society we use methods to distract us from our own actions. We create false ideas saying that we want to protect what holds us together but put our guns above ourselves and what really are guns but mass killing machines? In the video Gambino is taking two different stances one as a black man in the music industry and another as an american. In our society we want entertainers to dance and show off moves so we can be completely oblivious of whats going around us. He test this theory at the beginning of the video!!!!!! He shot a guy but we completely forgot and starting liking the music. It show how we pass over thing as american so quickly especially in the black communities. In the end when he is running is symbolic to even when we are enjoying life we are just running from the problems, so stop blaming, stop pointing fingers, and lets handle our shit basically!!!!!!!",1

Strange fruit they called it. the fact that it was true and still is true the black and brown people are being gunned down by the state by thugs with a badge murder over a thousand unarmed black and brown people every year.

25464,"Dog this is fucking stupid, America isnÕt all about this itÕs ironic because itÕs the other way around... the press and the social media make us as civilians believe that itÕs all bad things going on in the word, however they are just the mere curtain behind whatÕs really happening. They donÕt want us to know that behind all this bad is good and more so than that of the bad. You see the press just does this for political views and the term is called political manipulation. this is when a certain political group  make America seem like itÕs a garbage bag and that if you vote them theyÕll fix it. IÕm not saying childish gambo or whatever does this but I can definitely see some similarities, obviously heÕs doing this for views and money I mean thatÕs the whole reason for putting out music is for money itÕs a job for a reason. But he is trying to use a sensitive topic to us Americans to bring a cloud of attention onto himself for better reviews and better following if you think about it he is using political alienation. America is not all bad I used to think that to, you all have to understand that you need to form your own opinions on these things, listen to what IÕm saying but donÕt believe me, listen to what childish Gambo is saying. BUT DONT ever fully 100% agree with a certain perspective until youÕve formed your own idea about this. ALSO DISCLAIMER YOU WERE BORN IN THIS COUNTRY SO DONT HATE IT THATS CHILDISH MAYBE THAYS WHY HIS NAME IS CHILDISH GAMBO AND ASLO I AM 13 so believe me or donÕt I havenÕt fully developed the ability to act or think so donÕt come after my comment LIKE IF YOU AGREE",1

25477,"I smell a race war brewing in these comments lol Look, anyone can be racist. Anyone can commit an act of violence. I don't remember people with a lighter skin color being able to control the thoughts and actions of other people. Acting like it makes literally every party involved on the planet feel like they are being hunted for no other reason than their skin pigmentation. Welcome to the current world of America ladies and gentlemen; where there are no more laws that oppress others based on skin color, their sex, nor sexual orientation. But where little entitled brats create problems that were already being solved naturally just for the sake of having something to do/complain about. Truth is, and I'm sorry to say this, Tyrone doesn't stay with Letesha 90% of the time now in the inner cities. Reason why is because marriage is seen as a temporary now in the supposed ""black culture"" or in most cultures nowadays. There is gang violence that isn't being stopped because the dad's aren't there to stop it and straighten out their children, thanks babies momma's, and the cops can't stop the gangs and drugs they sell because of fear of being called racist, thanks to the feminists and Black Deaths Only Matter When We Can Use It For our Own Benefit (BDOMWWCUIFOOB). You want real oppression? Go to South Africa, where white farmers are regular target practice, and where it might soon be the case of where the SA government makes it illegal for them to own any land at all, creating a genocide situation. There's where your attention should be focused, my dear hate mob. SJW's grandstand on bodies while at the same time making problems worse. Sorry to say this, but every social group has a culture. And it's time for the brothers to drop their tough guy act, marry the girls they get pregnant, get that 9 to 5 job everyone in the current generation looks down on, and fucking man up. That goes for literally every single person in America who thinks of themselves as a victim for no other reason than a made up boogyman/their skin color. If you're seriously complaining about ""white privilege"" or ""systemic oppression by whites"" in America, then you obviously have something better to do with your worthless millennial life. Black women are the most educated group in America. You want to show me a law in action right now in the USA that prohibits blacks from doing something? Good luck. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a job interview to get ready for.",1

I live and work in the area where Trayvon was shot.This is the story that we saw in the local news that happened right down the street from where all that shit happened.----------------------------------------WFTV 9 ABC OrlandoCops: Man beaten with hammer, 2 arrestedSANFORD, Fla. - Two men were arrested in Sanford on attempted murder charges after trying to kill another man with a hammer, the Seminole County Sheriff's Office said on Monday.Deputies said Julius Bender, 18, and Yahaziel Israel, 19, were charged with attempted homicide, burglary with assault or battery, and armed burglary. Investigators said Bender and Israel beat a 50-year-old man with a hammer inside his vehicle and then took him into the woods near Beardall Avenue and Lincoln Street, where they continued to attack him. Investigators said a witness called 911 after hearing the victim's cries for help and seeing the beating.Bender and Israel drove away in the victim's vehicle before deputies arrived and abandoned it nearby, said investigators.Deputies said they found the victim in the woods, barely conscious and with severe head injuries. A tip received through Crimeline led investigators to Bender and Israel, authorities said.  Deputies said the witness identified Bender, and Israel was linked to the vehicle through forensic evidence.Bender and Israel were booked into the John E. Polk Correctional Facility with no bail.The victim's injuries are life-threatening and he remains hospitalized at Orlando Regional Medical Center in critical condition, deputies said.The victim's name was not released.----------------------------------------------The Reason there was so much Tension is because it's a Crime Ridden area.  These 2 Black guys hauled an old white guy out of his car and beat him to death with hammers, then stole his car.But,  you never hear this story mentioned even though it happened at the same time in the same neighborhood.

Already in the time of slavery the Negro became accustomed to feel victim of history, without assuming his participation and contribution in racism and racial violence. It was the negroes who captured and sold the slaves to the whites. The most amazing of this video:(1) Everyone is talking, discussing and interpreting. All the analysis I saw are from other people, I did not find and I saw nobody asking the author what he meant, that is, they are doing exactly what the video denounces;(2) The scene is chaotic, both white and black are suffering and practicing violence. Gambino says several times ""look what I'm whippin' up"". But everyone who is talking, discussing and interpreting ignores what the black interpreter is doing: killing other blacks!I could also speak, discuss and interpret the video to conclude that this work deals with social chaos, violence experienced by whites and blacks, mainly, deals with black victimization. However, I would first like to hear and know what the message the author wants to go through. Childish Gambino, what did you mean? Are you assuming participation and contribution in racism and racial violence? Were you surprised by the repercussion and not looking at what you were doing (killing blacks)?Bom dia!

Gambino diz vrias vezes Òolha o que eu estou fazendoÓ. Porm, todos que esto falando, discutindo e interpretando ignora o que o interprete negro est fazendo: matando outros negros! Eu poderia tambm falar, discutir e interpretar o vdeo para concluir que esse trabalho trata do caos social, da violncia vivida por brancos e negros, principalmente, trata da vitimizao negra. No entanto, eu gostaria primeiro de ouvir e de saber qual foi a mensagem que o autor quer passar. Childish Gambino, o que quis dizer? Voc est assumindo a participao e contribuio no racismo e violncia racial?

Ask anyone around and youÕll probably never find a racist even if you approach them as any other race theyÕll answer truthfully. Please stop bringing attention to this subject cause it makes kids disrespectful towards cops and more likely to not care about the law and get them in trouble. So if you care about black lives then you should stop capitalizing on the newsÕs love for BLM so you can get attention to this degree. Make a song about love or how we should support cops if you want attention. Kanye supported trump outspokenly and look how much attention he got. I know this isnÕt all for attention and you truly believe people and cops more specifically are targeting black kids but thatÕs not true and you wonÕt find probably any cops that say they look for black people. Black people on paper are the ones getting arrested more often and also resisting arrest or committing crimes during their police encounters and it makes sense that more accidents/ misunderstandings or whatever you call it are going to happen more often when the rates of anything go up like they have.,1

25717,"wakanda wake the fuck up people Charles B. PaulGlencoe's Human Heritage presents highly misleading passages about the African slave trade, inducing students to believe that it was initiated by Europeans, some 500 years ago, to furnish labor for European colonies in the New World. In fact, the overseas trade in black slaves was established much earlier, was established by Arabs, and was operated with the complicity of black rulers and black merchants. False beliefs about slavery are evidently popular, but promoting such beliefs in history books is a serious disservice to students. To put this practice into perspective, let me quote from a recent newspaper article by Thomas Sowell: A history professor wrote to me recently about one of his students who asked: ""Where did slavery come from?"" ""The real question,"" he replied, ""is, Where did freedom come from?"" Slavery is thousands of years older than freedom. It is so old that no one knows when or how it began. It existed among people of every color on every inhabited continent. The very word ""slave"" in a number of languages derives from the word for Slavs, who were enslaved for centuries before the first African was brought to the Western Hemisphere. Slavery exists at this very moment in Mauritania [a country in northwestern Africa], where 30,000 Africans are kept in brutal bondage. The only reason slavery is not still prevalent today is because Western civilization eventually turned against it and proceeded to stamp it out all over the world -- over the bitter opposition of Africans and Arabs, among others. Such things are seldom mentioned in our schools or colleges because it would not be ""politically correct."" What is taught leaves the impression that slavery is something created by or for one particular race. Freedom is even less understood. We take freedom so much for granted that there is little or no sense of what went into producing it -- or what is necessary to maintain it. Freedom does not just happen. It exists today in a relative handful of nations, and it has existed in that handful only in recent centuries. (I saw Sowell's article in the San Jose [California] Mercury News for 27 March. Sowell is a syndicated columnist whose work is distributed by Creators' Syndicate, based in Los Angeles.) Sowell has done well to remind us that the suppression of slavery was a Western endeavor, and that slavery still persists in Africa -- points that are routinely omitted from the history books and geography books used in our schools. I should add that the case of Mauritania is not unique. A recent report in the London Observer described the flourishing slave trade that has been instituted by Arabs in Sudan: The Arabs capture young persons in southern Sudan, force them to accept Islam and Arab names, and sell them for use within Sudan or for export to countries in western Africa or on the Persian Gulf.https://www.timesofisrael.com/thousands-of-slaves-in-israel-global-study-finds/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5LDAfQqIQkhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvZlh4XuY8w",1

People get shot, our jaws drop, then the next day, we are back in the media following trends and being diatractes by so many things that take away from the serious problems. I feel that the things in the backround really help push that point as we see Bino dance in the forefront and chaos happens in the back. We are supoosed to think, ""oh he's dancin and havin a good time up here, but woah wait, what's going on back there?"" I think this shows how easily we can lose sight of the problems going on, sometimes whether we intend to or not. America is plagued with problems. It's not all bad, but there's just so much going on, I think sometimes instead of keeping our minds on theses things, we distract ourselves, but not always with ill intent. It's like we get fed up with all this bad shit but turn away because either it'a not important enough to us or we just get so overwhelmed we give up because we feel we can't do anything about it, so we go back to shutting out America and it's problems so we can feel better.",1

25730,This video sucks,1
25731,"I assume no one is going to see this but hopefully atleast a person does and reads it completely. (Intro)Okay so I havent really read anybodies theories on the This is america video so I assume all im gonna say is word by word from my mind and what I think. So firstly the introduction of the video could have several meanings. Childish gambino could be acting out a normal black male that was influenced by alot of whats happening around him and turned into other ways for making a living and getting some oneAs you can see in the video gambino was far and gets closer and closer the the innocent black guy with a guitar. The guy with the guitar is just a regular man who is categorized as a black male and childish gambino can play two things now, Either another black male or the law in america. The buratality towards very innocent black men has gone out of hand and gambino protrays this brutality by killing the innocent man (gambino as the law and burtality and the man is the innocent victim) and then the gun that he has is taken away by another black male with a red napkin.Now in this scenario its meaning is that this black male is the same one thats dancing later on in the video with the group so this means that even though the black community is affected by this, everyone will soon forget about the death and the laws finger prints are earsed by the kids because they come up with things on the social media like challenges and dances that make everybody forget about it. Also 2 other people from the same group of kids pull him out of the frame and now its like it never even happened Another thing is that gambino could be playing a possible gang member killing an innocent black man for no reason and this brings up gang violence. The weapon is taken by another black male that is possibly from the same gang (bloods) since the napkin is red and they do whatever to make everybody forget about it or hide the fact that this happened. Although I doubt that this could be the actual explanation because there are no other signs portraying rival gang or gang members (crips)(Gettin into the vide)They are all doing trendy dance moves and they are sort of trying to hide everything thats happening and even though its in the frame, you dont really see it since this is whats grabbing your attention and hiding the facts If you pay attention, youll see a lightskin male (lightskins are categorized as black) ducking and running fast like he did something so the viral dance moves are gabbing your attention from the bad and the good. People in the community die for no reason what so ever and are forgotten fast because of the ways of entertainment People who actually do wrong in the community and should not be recognized as part of the african/black community are also not seen because of the entertainment that makes us defend even the bad when they trully did something wrong but we never saw because of the entertainment. Also if you look behind the group at minute 1:35 youll see the kid (black) over the car throwing money like its nothing while other people around him from the same community are struggling to make it and either die trying or live without it. This is shedding light at all the things that are wrong in the black community at the moment as well as the police brutiallity thats destroying it even more (church scene) They are all dancing and doing what they do and gambino walks in like hes part of them and then he kills them with an Ak. This could point out many things that have to do with gang violence too. A common refrence is made to ""choppers"" while making threats (Ak's or AR's)He walks in as he is part of the community, and ends up killing people that are far away from gang activity and violoence. This means one of the two things. They are either affected by the gang members actions in an indirect way that leads to them all dying or they are all affected somehow by the law and gambino represents something else again. Here donald can be possibly representing a church shooter who killed many people in the church And the kid with the red napkin can be representing how america is trying to hide the fact and get him out of it as gambino walks out like he did nothing As the camera turns the police car can be seen but its empty and you see no police men in the seen. This means that a police call has been made and they know about it but since gambino is representing a white kid. They obviously arent going to do a thing to him. so theyre not available (part after the church scene) As the camera is getting closer. You can here noises and screams of people that are affected by all the shit thats happeneing in america but here comes entertainment again to totally distort whats happening and make us deaf and blind This can be understood further more if you have a pair of head phones. As the camera is turning to the group. The noise can be heard but once the group start, its all gone but you can still see the chaos around. You wont be able to notice it though because all yuor attention is on the entertainmentNow there is a deep meaning with the tattoo on his bicep but i cant really read it but im pretty sure it has alot to do with the video as this is something everyone has missed or didnt really car about. I assume it says love is a power and then i cant really read whats under since its not that clear.(Near ending)Now the line ""This is celly, thats a tool"" can be pointing out alot but i heard that it meant cell, and its a tool to keep black males incarcerated but i doubt that since gambino made clear hand actions that this is a celly as in cellphone this can be pointing out alot. It can be that the cell phone is a tool because just one call and alot can be done. Or that the cell phone is a toold to record and show all the violence happening with proof and at the same time hide it with the entertainment available that makes you forget everything the man or woman wearing black on a white horse can represent death looking for its next victim. I am not very sure of this but it may be. (Outro) Gambino pulls out a joint, probably with marijuana inside. A substance used for calming, relaxation but was then banned in the US because of racism and how they thought it caused chaos the man with the guitar returns again and is there while gambino is dancing on the cars. SZA can also be seen watching gambino. This scence can mean the hope that they all have to be free and not be discriminated and the hope for a better day with no trouble or violence as there is no body around causing chaos.As the camera is zooming out you can see a person on the right with a water bottle and a hat. Im not sure what that means but i feel like no one caught that yet and it may mean something that i dont know of. then the scene where gambino runs in fear, means that as there is hope for a better day. Problems are still happening and violence is still occuring and hes doing his best to run from his fear and nightmares and hopefully escape it.",1

Think about how often youÕre distracted from yourself and your surroundings on a daily basis due to consumerism and social media thinking youÕre aware...but actually arenÕt. We are so easily distracted by little meaningless things that donÕt matter. Meanwhile, Glover is pullin out some moves and someone in the background being pushed off a le... *wait wait you see that move oooh he pretty... was that a migos ad lib??Lol. Who I canÕt for a meme. Also I feel like the children are South African by the way they dress and dance and how they represent multiple things. How people think black panther is some kind of revolution for us. When really itÕs just another distraction. now everyone is tryna be African n shit all of a sudden, how our youth deals with trauma, south African apartheid, how the same thing thatÕs happening here is also happening in Africa as well? Also anyone notice the evolution of African music at the beginning? Being peaceful and beautiful morphed Into what we have today as our version of modern day African American music. About violence, money and hoes.",1

25902,"I'm going to tell you all the most powerful truth behind this, which is revealed within the first 30 seconds. The man playing guitar is normal. Then as Donald dances toward him (note his face is contorted and strained) it is masked. The soulful music then abruptly changes to a typical rap beat after the trigger is pulled, and the strained dancing continues as the video does as well. As other's have pointed out his dancing distracts from the background. But what other's fail to notice is that he is saying he has to dance and act like that to get an audience. He's saying he has to say cliche things over cliche beats and bars because that's not what is expected of him but what is desired from him as an entertainer and a person. As if he's saying people want truth but don't want to hear truth. They expect the truth but want to be entertained when the truth says fuck being entertained, be soulful and passionate in life and the reward will be greater and on a greater scale than any trite sense achieved by partying and throwing your life away for a fleeting high and numbness. Also, if his message was primarily a race issue, it wouldn't have been himself pulling the trigger on the guitarist. He is saying his hand is being forced by what is wanted of him by the people.",1

25912,Fuck that was terrible... #1 on trending? You people are fucking retards..,1
25913,"I understand how the message of the video may be easily confused. But hear me out, the video isnÕt about how terrible terrorism, white people, police, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, right and left are. ItÕs about the people whoÕd see this video, hear this song, caught in the hype. ItÕs about us, the younger generations far too busy being oblivious to this pain, ignoring this pain, escaping this pain. We canÕt just escape this pain, we havenÕt actually dealt with this pain. This pain America has isnÕt something we can just drink off, itÕs not leaving on itÕs own. And do you know whatÕs fucked up?Our generations weÕre so lowly, we fucking escape our pain on social media...laughing at someone elseÕs pain. They say laughterÕs the best medicine but how does that help when people get hospitalized, bullied, depression over out laughs.You know what else is fucked up?We escape our pain by our pain and drama onto others. EveryoneÕs watching, laughing, getting hype, ÒOh Shiiiit. Oh shit. Oh shiii she jus saidÑÒ. Now we try to become winners in life in the same way that weÕve been trying to get higher than others. Instead of actually working on ourselves and improving as a person that takes too long we make others feel lower. NobodyÕs a winner here.NobodyÕs highly successful here.Only high people we have are stoners.We even have people in our generation who suck just as equally, who let people who cause this pain become winners. They get set up on a high horse in the name of our entertainment. We canÕt have Four Horseman if we donÕt give them a high horse. Pathetic we have become in our exchange of pain.Please refrain from establishing blame you may have felt in these arguments to escape pain it may have caused.",1

Called the American culture - instead of this American media culture that has been manufactured by a select (((few))) too keep you fighting each other and distracted.I'm not religous but *DO NOT* Worship false _prophets_ !Stop being a follower and be an individual.Almost all problems are caused because low lifes and betas of ALL animals form packs against what is natural for their well being. i'm not saying America is perfect. But its a hell of a lot better than where I am from .",1

26162,"Suddenly, all the black people became slaves! Stop this pathetic victim mentality and improve your black community. Start improving by removing the hood behavior, criticizing songs about guns, bitches, hoes, weed, drugs and violent behaviors. Thanks to the ignorant behavior of the american black community, ''hoods'' have the highest crime rate and it is done by blacks to blacks.... Poor milenial black kids think this is their culture! America, like all the other great civilizations, was built by crime, war and struggle. America is great because in america, blacks are equal to other races as it should be. Your great great great grandfathers jumped in the atlantic and they became slaves by colonizers. *NOT YOU* You can see the marks of slavery in almost everywhere in the world yet you act like it is exclusive to blacks because you are not educated enough. *America has bigger problems than a bunch of lazy and selfish black race ranters* If you are so entitled to your race, dont buy that *GUCCI* and buy a plane ticket to *AFRICA* You can see maggots crawling in piles of shit and you can even see blacks enslaving other blacks if you dare to visit no-gone zones.... Be like Dr. King, be like Akon, be like michael jackson.... be like Neil de grass Tyson! Dont be like those new generation 30 IQ ''rappers''. American history is black history as well as white history, as they got rid of slavery *TOGETHER* If you have a problem with that, that makes you a racist because you cant stand being equal to other races. This is why i like Trump, he values you by how hard you work.... not by your skin color.... Stop being so selfish and improve yourself as a human being.",1

26173,"Death on a pale horse meaning ""Hell followed with him"" as a police car drives behind the horse? Hip hop is always focusing on police brutality, but never addresses their influence on kids to act like mindless thugs with no respect for others in society, and ESPECIALLY not the law enforcement. Doesn't take a genius to realize the implications of a ""fuck you"" society that never helps bridge the gap of understanding. It's the ""me"" generation though. Everyone's trapped in their own feelings with no concern or respect for others. I realize this song touches on more than racism and police brutality and is somewhat vague in order to spark these kind of thoughts and debates, which shows how talented this guy is, but it seems misleading in painting only half a picture on who's the victim and who's to blame. He makes a good point about the lack of concern for human life, but most rap songs I hear now are pretty much either posing as a thug, waving guns around promoting violence, saying ""fuck the police"", feeding their own ego for a solid 4-5 mins, or talking about drugs. I can't wait for intelligence, independent thinking, manners, and respect for others to come back in style. The media turns us on each other for ratings then I try to listen to music to escape it, but they're all saying the same shit here too. I wish artists would give it a rest or switch up their message.",1

Coward ass men that can't even handle the responsibility of raising the children you create. Don't worry the white man will take up the slack and handle it. You people already get reparations. Its called the welfare system. Go find the black neighborhoods and you'll find the armpit of the town. Average I.Q. for a black in the United States is 88. The average in the U.S. is 105..

And, only 1% of blacks killed by police as 90% of cops are killed by blacks!The only dangerous thug killing blacks, are blacks!Black lives matter narrative... is bullshit!

It would be covered by every corrupt media source in the county! There would be riots! The person would be shamed and called a racist! Fuck these bullshit double standards. JUST IMAGINE!!,1

26226,This is a terrible song. TBH when the beat drops and things go terrible. Is gonna make more people wanna do that shit,1
26227,Donald looks like a witch doctor and his almost unnatural movements make him almost reminiscent of a snake. Maybe the message is life can appear beautiful but theres a lot of ugly underneath. Like a garden a snake can slither its way in waiting to do harm.

26239,"Whoever pressed thumbs down on this song/video is blind af. And struggles to see beyond beats and shallow lyrics. This is our life right now. Especially in the black community. Fascinated with these stupid ass dances, cell phones, fashion, and looking good for social media. All while doing nothing to better protect our youth, raise the youth right, or forge alliance against unjust police force. We are free thanks to God... but still targets. Wake up. And pray. Then act. Childish Gambino is genius for this... and beyond that he is conscious and aware. As a celebrity with his resume... That's highly commended.",1
26240,HeÕs talking about how society embraces black culture in terms of people loving black entertainers but donÕt give a shit about the violence in the black community. Notice how he poses like Jim Crow and the ridiculous dancing. HeÕs ÒcooningÓ and distracting from the carnage in the background. Also the dumb repetitive lyrics that are found in mainstream rap. Good video,1
26241,"In the beginning we see a man peacefully strumming his guitar. Then America (which I assume is portrayed by childish gambino) begins dancing while the guitar strums a beat. Throughout the video we see chaotic things such as gun violence, robberies, discrimination, ECT going on. Gambini shoots up a gospel group, which I assume is a reference to the Charleston shooting in 2015. Everytime he shoots someone, the gun is cradled and taken away carefully while the bodies are left or carelessly dragged away, showing American respect for the 2nd amendment but not for the people disadvantaged by it. While he's committing these awful crimes like gun violence him and the group of teenagers behind him continue dancing and smiling like there is no fuck given in the world. I think the overall moral of the video is that America has flaws but chooses to disregard them and focus on being cool, while the reality is, is that it is being torn apart. This is why he repeatedly says ""I'm so cold"" , and why there's a guy in the background throwing money around, because we care more about being cool, than we do about our society slowly destroying us...ive watched this video too many times on replay. And I've been left very very concerned on what might be happening in the background of America. I know I can't really do crap about it , but it worries me. Amazing job childish gambino thank you for opening my eyes more. #staywoke",1
26242,This is the usual shit I do when I'm in in the shower.,1
26243,Omg i feel ashamed to say I really like Childish Gambino __ all of his other song were so real and about him and his thoughts what is this shit #lilpumpshit i hate this,1

26253,"It's so interesting, the dance is to distract you from what's going on in the background. Which is the exact point he's trying to make, that we are so distracted with silly things like dancing, girls, drugs that we don't see the shit that goes on out there.",1
26254,this is some realist shit,1

26277,"Mr Glover. I think the left wing new world order media conglomerate are up to you. It slowly harder to come by this video or even search for it. I think they caught what you were trying to do and the checkmate position they were put in through you're masterful double twist I knew you knew that I knew that you knew what I was trying to do so I encrypted that into my piece. Its like they're going through damage control before more people realize what you were trying to show them and they're trying to stop it before their plans on taking over America by turning people into slaves by selling them on a corrupt culture they manufactured and pushed to incite a generation of outrage and distraction so that they can manipulate the emotions of people conditioned to act on emotion only. By doing this they will trick us into voting away and eroding our rights until we're nothing but a country of slaves. Dependent on the federal government and distracting ourselves with meaningless things that encourage that kind of lifestyle and stuck in this matrix of debt and commodity. Distracted by cheap toys and monopoly money of no intrinsic value and tricked into revering such worthless things and getting us to give them our money. Plan to use the power of outrage, fear of being offensive to incite a war of sensationalized violence so that they can chip away at our freedoms, rights, and will to take responsibility instead of blaming others for our shortcomings. First they will try take away our freedom of speech. So that those who don't accept their tyranny and are through the fog will not be able to enlighten the blind. Then they will take our rights to weapons making it impossible to stop them. Then they will take away our freedom by making us more and more dependent on government giving them more and more power until we are all equal. Regardless of gender, race, age, or religion we will all be equally poor and slaves to our debt and to the society we live in created by the new world order and ruled by the wealthiest few who control our media, education and laws. They will create a society where everyone is equal because they have taken the opportunity and ability of the average American to start a business and create an Avenue for economic growth, through the use of strict government regulations, control over the markets, and inexplicably high tax rate that busines it impossible to move up in the world regardless of merit. In this way the select few group of people who are born into wealth will stay wealthy forever and rule these idiots. And these idiots who gave them their freedom and rights will always remain poor slaves and continue to simply beg their masters for an extra bone, or a new iPhone, or for more painkillers, or for another gold watch. The weak emasculated men and the women that cuck them will never be able to break free of their delusions and those who try will be attacked by society for being an offensive bigot. I love how you're video was able to illustrate all of this welle at the same time giving them bait to latch on to and try to distract them from the message. And by doing so proved your true message. And even more amazingly you exposed exactly how they would try to distract them and finally the end results of their plan what they're intending to cause and where they're trying to get you to end up by choosing to stay asleep and stay in their matrix. Beautiful however futile it may be. It's too late as they've dumbed down the general population enough and have already succeeded in re-educating and baptizing this generation by feeding their fragile egos promising a fake heavenly paradise where we're all equal, and smart, and beautiful. Trying to goad us into allowing millions of illegal immigrants into our lands and to allow these people to vote for our future. They want to bring in millions of illegals and give the power to vote so that they can over power the will of the people and enslave us. They will bring in more and more illegal immigrants who will in turn of course vote entirely for the party that those fucking criminals in. And yes it's fact.  All illegal immigrant is a fucking criminals by definition. Because if you couldn't see it in the title. Illegal immigration is highly ILLEGAL. Which means it's against the to illegally immigrate here.  Which means it's a crime to be an illegal. That's why we call them illegals,  and not immigrants. Because legal immigrants are here legally. But of course people who immigrated here legally follow the law and you generally have to be smart and able to make America a better place. And those types of people don't vote for the left wing democratic party of the nwo trying to end and rob them of the opportunity that used to be the american dream",1

Well, part of it, anyways - as seen through the eyes of this artist.Cops are killing too many people without consequence (not just black people - all of us, the media just shows what they want, though). Cops have a difficult job - most will never understand - but wrong is wrong.Guns are not the problem - I hate that we always go back to this argumentMainstream ""black"" music is mumble rap aka garbage that talks about money, drugs and gunsOur country is the youngest and she has had growing pains but pales in comparison to the age of other countries. Instead of becoming a microcosm of their successes, we are their failures. Many nations have been built on the back of indentured servants of all shades. Wars have always been fought. Weapons will always exist. And where there is good, there is also evil.I feel like Donald Glover may have also been mocking vanity - not sure ""i'm so pretty"" or was that a dig on feminine men?Yes, blacks are free to be entertainers - but so are others. I felt like that's what ""get your money black man"" meant - like ""we"" just keep ""you"" for the entertainment - untrue... but that's his music video and his opinion and his art. (I know a lot of other shades that would love to have the gig - IJS)I'm so intrigued by the lyrics and imagery.. but I'm not going to read any more half ass articles using a thesaurus to say what they think he meant by it.

And that yes we don't consider every angle of approach but ""how can you see the picture wen your trapped in the frame"" - J.Cole",1

26316,"yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, Gambino(America) is the distraction, you supposed to be watching the background. After Gambino(America) commits a tragedy it distracts you from the riots and protests. That's why he says this is America after every tragedy he commits. Then around 2:35 he got a dude in all black riding a horse, I think that's supposed to symbolize death. Fuck, this nigga Gambino and Hiro are geniuses.",1

26326,"I think I get it.  He's upset with the state of black america.  Saying their culture has the potential to be about love and music with the guy in the beginning playing guitar, and also the choir singing (then getting shot, the death of that culture).  Now it's all about drugs and money.  I think he's saying the reason the black community is obsessed with money is because nice whips, and gucci clothes are pushed onto them through advertising/marketing, especially through music and modern hip hop culture, he seemed to be making fun of a lot of their dances basically  saying their shit is corny with his body language.Also, when the kids are following him around, he's showing the influence that the rapper has, because they are all following him around and copying him.  Meanwhile in the background, shit's on fire, cops are arresting people, and it's chaos.Then in the end the rapper dude is dancing on top of his awesome cars (really they're old and ugly), thinking he's rich because he's got a bunch of cars, but he's actually not that rich really.  Also, at the end he says something like you think ""you're a big dog, but the kennels in the backyard"" or something like that.  Saying you guys act like the big dog, but you're just a puppy.Then in the end when he's running away, he's showing how this is toxic and how he wishes they  could get away from it, and maybe go back to the peace and loving culture of the guitar dude and the choir people.",1

26348,"Hes just figguring out that u only Need a trap beat and some lame Punsh Lines to Create a Song that get so much attention.

Crazy ass world",1
26349,Why does my pump do fucking 9 damage ?,1
26350,"Wtf is this shit lmao? this must be a parody , right? ...",1
26351,"what i get from this is how ignorant people will see black culture embraced/celebrated/plagarized in the media and think oh well we've come a long way since slavery/segregation and then with the abruptness of childish gunning everyone down after the little happy scenes with choirs and dat he's like no there's a difference between instagram and real life trump's america, it aint slavery but its still fucking bleak with innocent people being shot for jack shit",1
26352,"Hate to be a dick but this was garbage (or at least overrated). His dancing was good but people compared it to mike Jackson. His rapping was terrible in this which is surprising since heÕs usually a great rapper and lastly people talked about how his video talks about political messages and while I saw them (Emmanuel baptist church shooting, police, etc.) I donÕt hear any lyrics that dive into depth about these topics besides Òthis is AmericaÓ",1
26353,Good video but the song sucks idk maybe I'm old,1
26354,He really hit that shoot and did that bitch so flawlessly I ain't know he was that good at dancing,1
26355,This shit crazy,1
26356,"Ain't nobody ready for this fuckin albulm, it's gonna be weird and beautiful. Well made video, weird trip,thanks Gambino",1
26357,"So IÕve watched this like 10 times and my favorite parts are his stance when he shoots the guy in the head, and when he busts into the room with the choir and all his expressions in the next 40 seconds. Like wow. Home boy just set the MFN BAR! Just like wow. This isnÕt just a great song, itÕs an amazing visual piece. Just YES. Like ok, I was already a little obsessed with him artistically but holy shit, THANk YOU Donald Glover. You wacky ass weird ass artistic genius.",1
26358,"Ooooooohhh haha this is going to spark some controversy :D Also, you gotta love the irony of this song and social media now. There are memes being made of the dances they're doing and adding some random shit like ""How i feel when my food is here"" or some random shit.",1
26359,Holy fuck,1
26360,"I think itÕs a lot simpler than what a lot of you are saying. Coming at this from a UK standpoint where we donÕt have any guns and (low and behold) there isnÕt any gun crime, this song is the first major political song to come out of the Parkland situation (and the ridiculous number of school shooting incidents in America atm). ItÕs very simple, and he doesnÕt need to do a lot with his lyrics at all: this is America - this is a real fear that people deal with every day, especially black people. And thatÕs fucking insane when you think about it. Kids scared to go to school for fear of being shot - young black men scared of being shot by police mistaking their phone for a gun. With regards to the production, IÕm sure thereÕs a lot you can pull the various styles that converge (the trap beat is definitely significant) but I havenÕt listened to it enough times to comment further than that",1
26361,this fucking beat is crazy,1
26362,oh shit another black escaping from the democrat plantation,1

26374,This shits dope as fuck wow,1
26375,What the fuck was this,1
26376,"Where in the fuck does the first gun come from?? You clearly see his whole backside with the slow fade in and theres nothing there, then theres a long shot of him dancing after he turns around.CGI maybe? or Someone clipped it to his waist that brief moment we only see his torso. IDK",1

26383,This is so fucking true. Like the school shooting that happened on valentines day that nobody cared about it til days later. We were basically distracted because it was Valentines day. Its sad but true. I absolutely love tgis because its sometging we need to talk about.,1

26385,the Yeah's are so fucking annoying,1
26386,"It's so obvi that there are a lot of references about social injustice within the black community. It's like when your uncle gets you through college ($), but he molested you when you were a kid (and then asks you to be grateful). It will forever haunt you - 3:53. It's also important to realize that CG's artistry can be a general statement for a lot of sad, unspeakable shit in this God-forsaken country. ""I'm so pretty""? More like, ""all of heads are up our asses worrying about insignificant shit (the media) that does NOT compensate for what's really going on, and what life is about."" #smelltheroses ppl. 2:10.",1

26401,"my interpretation of the ending is that since he was distracted by all the dancing,memes and etc he realized what was going on and was running from the terrors of the problems that is america and honestly i didnÕt even have to watch the interpretations to know all the shit that was going on...",1

I know I'm not helping the cause and personally I rather have people kill each other off in America. I'm fine with the way it is right now.  People on here though, they are fucking hypocrites....well most of them are.

How exciting! It must be a warzone there 365 days it seems according to the mind of a rich fuck who probably gets to travel alot and not even around or used the media itself to protrayed this. Can't wait to go to the US this summer so i can see how much of a battleground is it. Probably San Andreas there! I'll probably ""toughen myself up"" after this trip!",1

26535,"Powerful video.  Catchy as shit with good dancing too, but a lot of messages in this video alone. Respect!",1
26536,Just woke up and hit the dab rig then found this video....... so fucking confused,1
26537,Some of the gayest shit i ever seen,1
26538,"The dancing while chaos erupts= Black cultureÕs propensity toward ÔcooningÕ (the Jim Crow character stance and facial expressions, the fact that DG is not wearing a shirt akin to slavers belief theBlack man was nothing more than an ignorant,unintelligent, smiling animal to be put to stud) while ignoring real problems in our community. Young people with so little value for life that violence and death are entertainment as the pale horse of death rides free in our neighborhoods. But we care about being pretty (IÕm pretty line in the lyrics). The reference of the church shooting was obvious, but the fact that while the destruction was going on right outside of the doors of the church, the congregation was singing Ôhaving a good time in the LordÕ ignoring the plight of its people, also peep the money/collection plate references in the singing before the shooting. Folks missed the end that when the pale horse rode through, all other blacks disappeared and then the white mob took to chasing down DG as a runaway slave. So after the coons destroy themselves, the remaining blacks can/will be vulnerable. And some of the comments here are so damn shallow and short sightedÑtalking about his dancing (??? WTF) in the video it makes me sick. Wake the hell up!",1
26539,Well.  There it is.  The dumbest shit IÕve seen today.,1
26540,good video clip but shit song,1
26541,This is a shitty song and a horrid music video,1

26551,This song took childish gambinos original style and shit all over it,1

26553,Wow so the blacks are the only ones who suffer from racism right yeah that's bullshit this is America Land of the Free claim that we are all human we are not divided by race stop perpetuating racism........... kisses,1
26554,"Glover can't say publicly what the video and song mean, because he will be kanye'd and he's not big enough to handle that yet, not to mention he's working with Disney, probably the biggest payday anybody could EVER ask for, who will drop him instantly for telling the TRUTH in public - the video is pillorying black on black violence and how the black community ignores it, records it and even celebrates it, it is a *black* man that's doing all of the killing, including the murder of the *10* gospel singers (Dylan roof killed 9 people, if that was the point then Gambino absolutely WOULD NOT MISS THAT OPPORTUNITY) that represents the abandonment of God and church that's happening in the black community.  All of the while, an absolutely generic rap song (with a creepy horror movie undertone) about ""black man get yo money"" ""carry guns"" ""look so pretty"" and about how HIS LISTENERS, BLACK PEOPLE, OWE IT TO HIM TO FOLLOW HIS SOCIAL MEDIA is playing.  It's the most stereotypical rap song ever recorded and *that's the whole point.*And, oh yeah, all gray slacks are civil WAR confederate artifacts, now, apparently. Better tell that to LITERALLY ANYBODY WHO'S WORN A SUIT EVER.  If he wanted fucking civil war confederate pants HE COULD HAVE GOT ACCURATE ONES FROM HIS FIRST GOOGLE SEARCH, THERE'S LITERALLY 100 COMPANIES That SPECIALIZES IN MAKING ACCURATE PANTS AND HE'S GOING TO WEAR ONES THAT AREN'T ACCURATE IN A MILLION DOLLAR MUSIC VIDEO?

26562,Everybody riding this songs dick hard. Video is cool though.,1
26563,"This video speaks a lot, showing all sides of violence and not just what the trend is now. He speaks on true facts and not just what people force him to. I like the touch of all the different kills those from the urban jungle to the music scene and how youth ceaters to the next trend. Love how he touched points on how all the new mumbled rappers are setting a stage for the youths to be criminals and trying to be famous off trends not knowledge and determination. To bad all of these information will only reach some as majority of this song will be picked apart by closed minded people to fit their hatred instead of having no sides to see the big picture. Gambino is a talented and open minded person but get shut down by his own people once he try to express himself in ways they don't like. Black kills Black, White Kills White, White kills Black, Black kills White, Cops Kills Everyone(so say BLM). No one racist is better than the other but no one want to stop and face thier own demons, just blame it on someone else.We all got blood on our hands it takes the facts, not media's that's looking out to make a quick profit off peoples pain. People just eat the bullshit and no truth can change their mind.Like the great one said ""Choose Wisely"" - J. ColeAnd my favorite ""wait for the facts, we don't judge till it comes out"" - Donut OperatorBut then again ""this is America",1
26564,Better the second time around but I personally just don't fuck with Gambino's style,1

26571,it was the racist white that dislike like they always do they couldn't relate so they hate and the house nigga lol but pure art so much meaning how we view us and the subliminal message keep up the work no disrespect but u can only be black to understand __,1
26572,So another oppressed nigger Boon upset because it's a millionaires son which made a talent less  video screaming about America. Feel free to swim on back Spook.,1

26588,shit song,1
26589,"Satire is a very tricky and dangerous literary and film gender.  Black stereotyping / representation and performance have been so ridiculed throughout history, with us as the butt of the joke, that we have be mindful that we are always Critiquing and not Re-inscribing White Supremacy Notions of what the Dominant social group supposedly ""Know"" about us.If you are not familiar with Jim Crow History and media discourse, some of the video's could get lost.  Certainly, the comment on Black consumerism /social media narcissism and ""Prosperity"" rhetoric hustlers comes out clear.I liked the reference to the Charleston 9 - Dylann Roof Tragedy...wish Glover had put on a White face / Dylann Roof mask for that one !",1
26590,"Okay, what the actual fuck am I hearing here?",1
26591,So everyone is Gunn ignore that nigga jumping off the second floor from the made up prison balcony,1

26597,"So are we just gonna keep getting this leftist corrupted media and art that keep reminding us of how fucked up our past was, when are we gonna move on and live in the present with out the constant reminders of who fucked who, holy shit Democrat holy shit people, why do you promote this idiocy, I'm not saying that the past was good, but to relive it and to keep reminding people, those who had no hand in what their fathers did is beyond fucked up, get over it, enough...... Fuckin enough",1
26598,"my interpretation is that whilst there are violence and tragedy taking place around us (shooting, riot, even suicide/murder with the guy jumping off the first floor in the background @ 2:14), most of us are blinded from them (as the focus remains on Gambino + dancers throughout the entire vid) to the point that we embrace it as a norm/culture (""guns in my area...I gotta carry'em""; the huge contrast of the two melodies; how uneasy Gambino looks and moves when the music/vibe isn't aggressive enough vs how happy all the dancers are when it is). We, especially the younger generation, even dance and sing to the violence we experience (as all the ""students"" only join in during the rap verse; how the lyrics resonate the generic rap songs about guns and money and how much the ""students"" enjoy them;  and how the vid emphasizes the ""Shoot Dance"" @ 2:33) Meanwhile, some of us are aware of the situation but choose to stay quiet and anonymous, and literally rather ""film""  (@ 2:28) the violence in front of us than to do anything about it, until a gun is pointed at us and all shit breaks loose (as everyone runs away @ 2:44).I think this vid also metaphorically illustrates how easily accessible guns are in the US (how they keep magically appearing in Gambino's hands), and how everyone is in fact terrified af (as everyone runs/ tries to run away from the darkness at the end).I've never made such a long comment but this song is sooooo amazing I just can't contain myself. Genius, Gambino. Simply genius.",1
26599,"If I catch mr Glover comment on ""white people dancing"" I'm gonna call his shit out.",1
26600,Can someone list all the references it's like fucking JoJo in this video,1
26601,*i don't know why fucking love that facial expression at* 00:40 lmao,1
26602,Yo why isnÕt this trending what kinda bullshit is this????? Fucking logan paul shit smh,1
26603,america suck,1
26604,"The video and the ""message"" in it is shit. Turn off the ""news"" talk to your neighbors and you'll find out that America is much more harmonious than we are being told. This indoctrination needs to stop and it's shit videos like this that spread that false message. Even Morgan Freeman said on CNN to Don Lemon that it's all a myth, He said ""The mere fact we are sitting here talking says otherwise"". Stop believing and spreading this crap and you'll enjoy life a lot more. America is EQUAL OPPORTUNITY NOT EQUAL OUTCOME, Remember that. Donald Glover running his mouth comes from the same generation that gets participation trophies instead of being told sorry you didn't win.",1
26605,I'm normally not into more mainstream music but s shit was pretty good yo,1
26606,"PPL DONT LIKE IT CAUSE THEY DONT WANT PPL TO UNDERSTAND THE REAL MEANING OF THIS WHOLE SONG......  All the chaos in the  background yet we still wanna get whips cribs and make dance videos its all distractions ... the stance when he shot the man in the beginning was the jim crow stance go look at ""jump jim crow"" song im not racist at all but this song has so many meanings shit thats in plain view but nobody bother to pay attention to.... but since this one is like a #1 in america right now u cant leave out Lucas joyner's I'm not racist song check it out to yall",1
26607,The dumbest shit I have ever seen.,1

26622,Lol this song really sucks compared to his other stuff and Is the video supposed to be edgy and offensive?? Its really not. I guess to millenials and pop fans that dont know any better this is new and Edgy though. Im not being a hater the song really does suck its awful and for somone like him Thats actually capable of making good music he is just being last. He knows people are stupid and it will sell because of the fun imagery and violence so basically hes a sellout and a fake.,1

26637,This video is sooooooo dope!  All the shit going on in the background.  But you're easily distracted by the dancing and entertainment that u don't see the obvious mayhem coming. .  Its a genius metaphor on so many levels. Did you see the guy on the white horse?  Or the guy fly off the balcony?  The shit is soooo dope,1
26638,"People get killed for no reason everywhere. And racism is much more prominent in other places. I respect the message and the execution, but Òthis is the whole fucking earthÓ is the truth",1

26652,1.56 shit escalated quickly,1
26653,"Huh.. saw a piece on this on pbs news hour. Cool video, but I think violence greed and oppression is a whole lot more than an American problem. America has it's bad points still, but show, for example, a ""This Is Syria"" if, you want to know what torture and mass bombing of it's own citizens looks like.. Or a ""This is Somalia"" if you want to know what happens when warring tribal factions run things, and decide to commit genocide by sweeping through entire villages, murdering all the men, forcing the children to kill each other to get a chance to join as a child soldier, and keeping some of the women in cages as they go, as sex slaves. Or so many other extreme cases around the world.That all might have sounded like I went on a big patriotic rant but that wasn't my intention, it just happened to be what I thought of when I watched this video, a mix of enjoying the Choreography, music, and concept but still thinking.. even with all the violence and chaos this is displaying.. the unemployment rate in this country is insanely low, and there are so many more opportunities in this country to survive. for the lower income in this country life is tough.. but not impossible to get out from under. So you work two jobs and bust your butt to slowly start improving your lifestyle and eventually you will have at least a decent life, as in a house/apartment to live in with clean running water, electricity, sewage, a stove and microwave to cook, then eventually a car to drive.. ect ect. That doesn't excuse the racism and violence that can plague some neighborhoods, but compared to say the tens of millions of people trying to flee their own countries because they might get bombed or murdered any second.. This Is Reality",1

26770,"The loudest messages in this video according to my opinion are:1. A majority of rappers are not saying shit when there is so much going around them2. Guns are treated better than people (always carried away in cloth)3. Jim Crow messages in the gun pose and dance. 4. The dancing, drug, and gun talk in rap distracts from the real world....but hey it sells5. Black man needs to get his money even if the music he is making does nothing for his people and only gives others a tool to generalize.",1

The fact that someone even *has* to make this video in an attempt to show people the state of one of the most ""developed"" countries in the world is horrid. The fact that someone even *has* to ""shock"" us with the shootings and killings of children and POC in such a casual manner - mixed with the lyric, ""This is America"" is appauling.

This video is showing domestic terrorism, police brutality, gun violence, chaos in the background but instead of seeing whatÕs actually happening and focusing on that, we are distracted by the upbeat dancing and cheery facial expressions. ItÕs very true, whenever something big happens in the news, people barely acknowledge it before they move their focus to shit that donÕt matter. Society has become numb to whatÕs really going on.",1

26867,fuck america,1
26868,"You saying ""we gotta whip our guns around"" and that there's ""guns in my area"" basically means you're blaming guns for the violence. When a stabbing happens, we don't blame the knife. When someone gets hit by a car we don't blame the car do we? So why are guns any different? I shoot guns all the time. I hunt with them and my family uses them for self defense. When my uncle shot his hand off he didn't blame the gun he blamed himself for accidently pulling the trigger. The part about kids on their phones so much and being blinded with them is very true. But I can't stand that you sit there and blame the guns. The places with the most strict gun laws seem to have the most violence (just look at Chicago and California). If there's a solution to this, it's to give MORE guns to the GOOD guys so we have some way to stop the BAD guys with the guns faster than dialing 911. You can never 100% get rid of guns in America. Just like weed and drugs, they are banned and illegal but Christ, people at my SCHOOL smoke weed. People will always get guns. And 90% of the time the bad guy with the gun either has it illegally or it's someone else's. So if we have more good guys with guns than we have a better chance to fight them. Just look at Texas. Most guns in the U.S and it practically has the lowest crime. And it's mostly bcuz the GOOD guys have so many guns that nobody wants to fuck with them. The very few crimes that happen are almost always stopped by a good guy with a gun. Such as that one church shooting for example. And you say the police nowadays are trippin. That's total fucking bullshit and you know it! Most of the time the man charges at the officer, forcing them to open fire. Very very few times was there a random ass cop going around shooting people. The media just turns it into a racial issue and it's dumb. If you don't want skin color to matter, than stop bringing it up all the time for every little thing saying it's racist. There are so many more GOOD cops than bad so stop letting the minority ruin it for the majority.Face it America, banning guns and further restricting them is definitely not the answer and for the politicians on BOTH sides: focus more on the well being of the American people instead of going against the other more. I'm a conservative and I see hypocrisy on both sides. I know this comment won't do much, but at least a few people will see it and hopefully read it all and let them see the truth.",1

26987,"This is SO MUCH better than the more recent rap music. The thing that jumped out at me first was that the high hat sounds, while they are the same sounds as the other rap songs, it had a much more different pattern from all the rest. I also liked the fact that this song has more than one emotion conveyed in the actual music, contrary to most shit out there. Also, I heard auto tune being used only as an effect in the background vocals. Also the lyrics and the video are deeper than look at all my money and fukin hoes. They are actually THOUGHTFUL!!! It's warms my heart that there are talented musicians in every single genre. Some less than others, but talent is present in all of them. Thank you for bringing actual music in an age of dog shit!",1
26988,so fucking addictive,1
26989,"I'm 100% that people are going to hate me because of this comment but it's the truth. This video should have been called ""This is Africa."" Or ""This is the world."" because the music video doesn't show shit about America. This video only represents about 15% of America.  What about Chinese people, Americans, Jews, Russians, and Canadians? Black people aren't the only people that get attacked,  What about Anti-Semitism (Hatred towards the Jews), or Sinophobia (Hatred towards the Chinese) Anti-Semitism is sky rocking in America and across the world so is Sinophobia. This video should also show School Shooting, Suicide, Drugs, and Polive brutality towards ALL PEOPLE!  Let the hate comments begin!",1

I mean he did just murder like 11 people. Then there was a random nigga on a horse. Is the message that America is unpredictable and changes in the blink of an eye? Or is this just America from his point of view? Is this directed to 1 state in America or America as a whole? I'm guessing it's a perspective thing and this is from his point of view of the area he's from and he's just viewing all of America from the perspective of his area.

I can't believe that though because this is the same retard that got on a stage and legit said that Donald Trump made black people the most oppressed group in America.

27112,Fuck racism and fuck all racist all over the world (America)______________________,1
27113,Imagine Donald sitting on his phone reading the comments like: ohh shit that's too deep I didn't even mean that.,1
27114,where the stuff about the false rape accusations,1
27115,The song sucks but I like the video.,1
27116,Dope as fuck,1
27117,If a nigga shoot me like that I need a redo,1
27118,"This is an ASPECT of American, is it a real and shitty stain among many stains of America? Yes. But if may add something to the microcosm of texts in the comments. I find it to be ignorant to think that people don't turn a blind eye to these acts of violence, however to think that this JUST America view one tges things is equally moronic. ""I never seen this happen, the are May people live nice live here, friendly people."" ""RARARAH, THIS ISS AMERIKKKA, open your eyes, get woke, face truth sinners."" Many ACT as if they speak of truth, of one's reality but everyone ( me too) ignore the real shit that's going on and no I'm not saying that these are not issue but that the assumptions of America is against *insert meaningless  bull here* person fails to understand the real America. It's not, ""it not the systems against us"" it's America system is broken in general. You ask ""America"" the look at this (when you mean MOSTLY white people) but you see this as if they do this to black people in general. OF COURSE THEY ARE. America's spend more time, arguing about meaningless shit, meanwhile ignoring that are Earth is going to shit, tension with superpower are straining and are news media becoming homes for extremists. But that's still an aspect. There are many places that doesn't feel like world is ending, there are good people here. Black people maybe victims in some way but that doesn't mean they don't play the game either. If anything is taken out of the rambling is that there is no other, no apocalyptic America. Just shitty people in a crowded field.",1
27119,"This is America, don't catch you slippin up. bruh this the shit that comes between the lines when you live here.",1
27120,"I really came around to this. Hated it at first. But i think listening to it with headphones or on a good speaker set up is key. Too much is going on in the beat that it sounds like a mess on low end speakers (phones). But i love it now, its fucking great!",1
27121,Holy shit,1
27122,what  the  fuck !i ?,1
27123,"It amazes me how white people give their view point on black artistic expression when in all actuality they canÕt relate to one trial or tribulation that weÕve ever encountered and endured so when we express ourselves, itÕs from a place that only WE understand. Excuse my language but fuck fuck off please to all those who canÕt relate to me and my people.",1
27124,What the fuck did i just watch? :/,1
27125,This shit is so wack,1
27126,"As a white African, this song kicked my ass. Glover is the shit in most of what he does, I had Redbone on repeat for months-  but this shit is polemical, from the imagery to the sentiment. It's homely, but at the same time Its segregating. From Death riding on the Pale Horse being chased by the pigs, to him dancing with kids singing that we're the entertainment. There's alot of cracks in society we need to fix, and I might be white, and you might be black but goddamn man  we're all pink on the inside. We are who we are, and as my dad told me ""keep loving, keep living"". Keep singing the praises, there's people around the world who love your music and who love you - no matter the pigment. Bless",1
27127,Some bad shit are happening in the background. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm,1
27128,This shit fire af,1
27129,"He's perpetuating black on black violence. If a white guy where to shoot black people in a video all you idiot liberals would be up in arms. But somehow the Liberals don't give a shit when black people get killed by other blacks. Notice how the BLM never gives a flying fuck anytime a black man is killed by another black man in Chicago? All the liberals, blacks and the BLM are nothing but hypocrites.",1
27130,Da fuck,1
27131,so is this the trendy music nowadays? or something which explains whats really going on in the real world? because if it is music it sucks,1
27132,Why does he keep teasing me with these clutch ass 21 Savage adlibs. I keep expecting a verse to pop off,1
27133,"I know that IÕm white and so I donÕt have a soul but...I mean...I just donÕt think itÕs all that deep. I see people giving their interpretation of what they believe the video to represent but...I feel like the concept of highlighting problems is trite and an easy way to come off as socially conscious and deep but IÕd rather people focus on ways to move forward and present realistic solutions rather than continue to highlight problems. Everybody knows there are problems so when you speak about violence or the president, etc, should you really be praised at this point? I know IÕm going to get hate for this post but IÕm not even talking shit about Donald. Donald is an artist and should be able to express his art however he feels. It doesnÕt matter if I agree with him or not. IÕm tripping off the praise this is receiving. It is visually interesting. Is there symbolism in this vid? I would imagine so. Is it worthy of the praise youÕre all giving it? I mean...not to me. But like I said, IÕm just a soulless white guy. What do I know?",1

You play the victim because you want to be the victim because you won't get brownie points for your dumbfounded multibillion-dollar bosses who want to keep you oppressed.

27177,This is shit why have so many people liked and watched it,1
27178,"Absolutely love this video clip. I am part Caucasian yes, but I am as Multicultural and as a forward-thinking as they come. This video clip is so true - racism existed a hundred years ago, and it still exists today. Society has a long way to go. I spent 3 months in Kenya as my GAP year, in a compound living amongst true Africans (poor, with nothing to offer but love, friendship and loyalty). My memories from Kenya give me hope for the future: WE ARE ALL EQUAL. If you disagree, then you are a racist bigot; conservative; backward; old-fashioned; old. Racism and any sort of discrimination is never okay. I might be white, but I praise Steve Biko, Nelson Mandela, Barack Obama for changing the way the way people view each other. Open your eyes people! Or better yet, open your hearts. _ Love, peace & harmony to all, L xx ___________ PS. Do something that someone who sees would be proud of, today.",1
27179,"This is what people find artistic, symbolic and chilling now? why, We already have a look into what happening into black America, and America in general. The topic has been pushed down everyone's fucking throat by the media for years now. Its pitiful how this is being praised as some kind of incredible symbolism and shows how much of shallow thinking sheeple the general population is. Even the song itself isn't great. Don't get me wrong, I know there is a problem in America and i'm not being negligent but the public response to this is sickening.  the redeeming factor behind this is great choreography and the production quality of the video is great. The amount of praise this is getting you would think he is Gandhi, lightning himself on fire in protest.",1

27191,fuck genius!,1
27192,He blew away the choir i was like okay that's fuckin gangsta.,1
27193,"Looks to me like he's making fun of how ridiculous the status quo has become when it comes to what's trending in America. Shit went from soul moving enlightening music to just wanting to party, where it all turned, to gotta be gang related and getting money. Almost every lyric in the track is the kind of key word gimmicks record labels want to see their artists saying in songs. You see the guitar player and even the choir get gunned down. All this running around and foolishness in the background in line with popular rap music of today all the while the school kids are dancing to it and loving life like it's all good. He tossed out all the get money sell drugs I'm cute look what I got that's lame don't fuck with me or I'll send shooters after you etc etc etc bullshit America is on. Meanwhile we're just all cool with it dancing on to the tune. That's really what it is most of the time when you get past the self images people have of themselves, a bunch of mfers talking about I get it I get it I goes in I goes in I get money I get money and they're driving around in fucking hoopties where Becky and Crystal are surely nearby somewhere. Honestly what I see almost the same of is people who were born with money already and have nice things that were given to them so they use it to pretend like they earned that lifestyle by being some kind of drug dealing gangbanger cause that's the category they want to fit in. When he says black man get your money I feel like too many kids are going to take that as yea I gotta get this money in the trap blah blah like an idiot. I'm pretty sure Glover would mean get your money as in become a genius enterprising individual earning real legitimate money intelligently like he himself does.",1
27194,"He's basically saying you're being brain washed, Everytime a tragedy happens ""they"" wash it off with some dance or new song and while there's all this real shit happening in the background were too busy looking at stuff like what Kanye is saying instead of looking at the real issues that are happening in the background",1

27209,Bro this nigga is trash. He's a talented person in the acting industry,1
27210,"If this is America, then why more of us black people are killing each other than any race in America? How about make a video on black stop killing other blacks? I guess Donald Glover don't see the statistics on that. And I see why most of us blacks today complaining about oppression and slavery. It was all in the past and we're never been through it. The future is gone, because we blame the white man for our fuck ups. Motherfucker please! Worry about on how us black people teach others on making a better future instead of bringing up shit from the past.",1
27211,fuckin brilliant !!!,1
27212,the video has a big message We are all paying attention to his dancing and the things he does But does anyone notice the chaos in the back There are people dying and getting chased by police but nobody notices And everytime something happy happens there's always something to destroy it Such as shootings and devastating shit and there are hidden messages Its basically showing you how america really is  and how shitty it really is but only no one realizes it because of the entertainers singers dancers and youtube So there ya go,1

27221,first sell out song hes produced. Such a shame. But hey atleast the retarded mass public likes this song. At the end of the day its all about making money right?

I can tell you right now that everyone who's not living in your country got the message loud and clear, and I'll tell you something else too: The fact that you people don't get the critic and/or the irony in the video and music is what scares the rest of the world. Let me put it in context for you:Freedom, education, fun and all those basic rights that you people take for granted cus it's the US... are all guaranteed by violence and guns under the excuse of the whatever amendment guarantees your right to have a gun to ""protect yourself"" which in itself is being mocked as well and is, quite honestly, a fucking retarded amendment that doesn't fit in the 21st century.

27404,OK video ..... song still sucks however,1
27405,Damn I just realized I got a old ass picture for my profile __ anywho I think gambino is saying here that the media is distracted by what we do im front of the camera to distract us from the message behind them the fact on how thatÕs how America really be it really be just shooting one another riots and we donÕt even see that we see the slick ass dance moves and the dope ass ways they doing it .. we donÕt see complete chaos in the back,1
27406,holy shit this is good,1
27407,"It so sad to see people believe that the left is for minorities when it has such a long history of fucking them over and destroying their communities. They managed to infiltrate our history and change it most people don't realize that slavery was democrats.  As Facebook, google and other groups continue censorship of right wing ideas it becomes all the more clear to me who the villians are of this country. I fear to many sheeple won't realize untill it's to late. Do your research fokes, look at the different state goverments, their poverty rates their murder rates the economic growth. It paints a very clear picture. Never vote in people on the federal level who want to take your rights. And don't be a pawn to the liberal agenda.",1
27408,What the fuck is this and why is it recommended to me,1
27409,i see some priviliged guy who has been fucking rich for a long time and never had to work a real job,1
27410,"In the beginning we see a man peacefully strumming his guitar. Then America (which I assume is portrayed by Childish Gambino) begins dancing while the guitar strums a beat. Throughout the video we see chaotic things such as gun violence, robberies, discrimination, etc going on. Gambino shoots up a gospel group, which I assume is a reference to the Charleston Church shooting in 2016. Every time he shoots someone the gun is cradled and taken away carefully while the bodies are left or carelessly dragged away, showing American respect for the second amendment but not for the people disadvantaged by it. While heÕs committing these awful crimes like gun violence him and the group Instagram teenagers behind him continue dancing and smiling like there is no fuck to give in the world. I think the overall moral of the video is that America has flaws but chooses to disregard them and focus on being cool, while the reality is, is that it is being torn apart. This is why he repeatedly says ÒIÕm so cold,Ó and why thereÕs a guy in the background throwing money around, because we care more about being cool, than we do about our society slowly destroying us... IÕve watched this video too many times on replay. And IÕve been left very very concerned on what might be happening in the background of America. I know I canÕt really do shit about it, but it worries me. Amazing job Childish Gambino thank you for opening my eyes. #staywoke -Seth",1

27415,"Tupac wrote his song ""Changes"" in 1992. ""Cops give a damn about a negroPull the trigger kill a nigga he's a hero"" ""Give 'em guns step back watch 'em kill each otherIt's time to fight back that's what Huey saidTwo shots in the dark now Huey's dead""""I see no changes all I see is racist facesMisplaced hate makes disgrace to races""""And although it seems heaven sentWe ain't ready, to see a black President, uhh""""And still I see no changes can't a brother get a little peaceIt's war on the streets and the war in the Middle EastInstead of war on poverty they got a war on drugsSo the police can bother me""Only one of these lines actually changed. America had a black president for 8 years, who had no affect on anything.  It actually made things worse, because the white Americans resented black people even more so that they elected Trump!For the rest of the song, change ""crack"" to ""opioids"" and ""fentanyl,"" there you have the exact same world. In 26 years, nothing changed and a lot of things got even worse. As it goes in the last line of the theme song form ""America's Funniest Home Videos;"" America, this is you!",1
27416,I like all the people completely missing the point and calling the music shit,1
27417,"I remember 5 years ago people were typing status ... like only white people listen to childish ... he's not about black culture... but then they would bump some stupid shit about selling drugs ... for one selling drugs isn't black culture its American... white brown and grey and yellow ..  number 2 this man put a video out ... and brothers are out here supporting him like they weren't  just trynna put him down for ""sounding white""",1

27543,I know I am not black but I really hope this a eye opener to black people.. please pay attention to what you are listening too and supporting. What this video represents and what heÕs saying is an eye opener and do not ignore it. All these fake ass rappers making yÕall do these stupid ass dances and that stupid gang shit ainÕt taking you no where good. Killing each other over colors and bullshit. Listening to trash ass artists making you feel like you  gotta do what they  do rap about  doing drugs and shooting mfs and living by a gun. Just stop. Why do yÕall think police always on yÕall for the littlest things. Because a lot yÕall shoot over anything. But you know what I can relate to the cop abuse and gang bs because I am latina and us Latinos get a lot of shit and kill each other over the same shit. And itÕs stupid. Killing each other. What we need to do is come together. ItÕs easier said then done but I mean come on. The end of times is fucking near. And weÕre going to wind killing each other than helping one another and staying here and going strong. Us combined would fucking do damage to these pigs and white people who think they can run all over us and rn they are because we let them by all of these deaths taking out another black person taking out another Latino and thatÕs what they want!! All that gang shit is bullshit. Killing our people for little things. I mean what the fuck is wrong with our people. The black community has it hard bc the media makes yÕall look so fucking stupid and makes yÕall the bad guy any little thing itÕs yÕall who are wrong ! YÕall could do a good deed and on the news they will say Ò ex con young black male helped save a child from drowning Ò like wtf? And itÕs true because IÕve seen shit like that over here where IÕm from! They donÕt want yÕall to be the good guys  !!! And thatÕs bs. Bc ThereÕs so many good people so many educated black men and women hard working and doing great! They want to tear yÕall down and us Latino people. We need to let go of our egos and become one. Fuck that racist shit. ItÕs 2018!!!!!!! I know IÕm rambling but shit I hope yÕall understand what IÕm coming from _______!!!!!!! Just tired of this media shit. Love one another yÕall !!,1

27625,Did anyone understand what the fuck he was saying,1
27626,"THIS IS WHAT I PERSONALLY THINK AFTER PUTTING TOGETHER SOME INFO (PS: TO THOSE WHO THINK THIS IS DUMB OR WOTEVA THIS IS MY OPINION SO CHILL)If you haven't noticed in the beginning when he dances it is in the stance of the photo of Jim Crow, and I'm pretty sure in the video its messages relates to the Jim Crow laws , Trayvon Martin shooting and the tragic church shooting. If you pay more attention to the background or whats happening around Glover, you see the fact that after he shoots the man in the beginning, a boy runs up with a red cloth and covers the gun with it, this happens for both the shootings, and I guess it symbolises the fact that guns and such weapons are seen more valuable then human lives. When you skip to the part were there are kids on top of him while Glover is dancing with the other school kids, the sentence he sings is "" This a celly , that's a tool"" and they are  all holding phones and I guess it means that the media controls everything we see now days and its a tool they use to manipulate people decisions.Also at the end, Glovers running in a dark passage way with dim lights and is being chased by the people in the video, in the background, and he looks terrified and looks to have been running for a long time, I guess that symbolises the fact that he snapped out of the trance and all of a sudden his back to reality . The trance was what America opposed and fabricated about reality and what is really fucking happening,  and Glover running with the terrified face,  represents the fact that, as hard as you try to run away from it all, it still gets to you , no matter who you are.",1

27699,Honestly to me the song is okay but the symbolism is what makes the song stand out. I am just saying this because I hear people saying this song is great without the video but honestly this is usually the type of music that would be despised if it came out from lil pump or sixnine and other shit rappers.,1
27700,"shit was so scrambled no idea what this is or why 80 mill sat down to watch it, kicking myself because I watched it . I don't think Glover is a bad guy, has bad ideas or is a bad artist but the what he was trying to didn't really pan out.  He should have maybe made an album laying out his issues with the country because trying to address problems with the youth, modern rap, the black on black crime and whatever he feels towards white people in a 3 minute song was too convoluted. Safe to assume that everyone watched because it was popular, saw a black guy dressed up like a slave dancing and rapping about america looked at the title and instantly called it Grammy worthy, inspirational, genius etc. I mean not terrible but definitely not revolutionary. Kinda feel the same way about this song as I do about ''get out'' as a movie.",1

I am a black man in America, with no felonies, no record, but have been mauled by police and stopped by them more than the average white citizen. I have been called a nigger mor times than I can count, without even doing anything to be insulted in that manner.

27773,"This is stupid. This is a paradox. Violence begets violence. Are our people too ignorant to see beyond the spectacle? Why do we continue to fill our minds with images that continue to normalize the killing of black people? Do you not realize that as the younger generations consume such imagery that this kind of violence becomes acceptable? We are desensitizing our own people to our own slaughter! Do you not realize that the rap industry is not controlled by the black man? I gurantee they would not air a white choir getting shot down in a rap video, but for black people getting shot down, they eat that shit for sustenance, literally, for they capitalize on our degredation. And here we are in 2018 defending the public killing of our own people. This is the equivalent of the mob that turns a hanging into a public spectacle only now the ones being hung are the audience members enjoying the killing of their own kind and dancing to it. NOW is the time we stop acting like niggas and start acting like men! We need to unite and not support our own demize. Fuck being ""woke"", just wake your asses up.You do not deserve to be black if you cant see beyond this deception of mental slavery.",1
27774,"seguramente de las 112 milhones de personas que han escuchado esta cancion e visto el viedeo-clip no han entendido lo que el artista queria criticar en este vdeo.El clip esta lleno de simples detalhes que transmiten la realidad en que vivimos e no nos damos quenta, aqu van los detalhes:- El vdeo empiea con una msica alegre que transmite felicidade, pero esta felicidad es falsa yq que en la letra dice ""go away- vete"". Despues el protagonista empiea a bailar e derrepente saca una pistola e mata a la persona que est en la silla e justo quando suena el sonido de un disparo el estilo msical cambia drasticamente e passa a una musica que trasnmite miedo( passamos de una ""alegria"" a un ritmo bajo e la letra refuera para que despertemos para la realidad)- Al principio del vdeo el protagonista ""mata"" a la persona que  supuestamente estava tocando guitarra, pero no lo sabemos porque tiene la cara tapada (esto significa que no nos importa porque hoy en dia quando escuchamos q murieron miles de personas pensamos durante apenas unos segundos e despues volvemos a la vida normal como si todo estuviera bien). Otra cosa que se pretende demonstrar es la facilidad de como en los EUA se consigue un arma. Por ultimo, lo que mas impacta e que viene a reforar la idea de que no valorizamos las cosas es el facto de como despues de matar al ""enmascarado"" recongen el arma con un pao rojo con extremo cuidado e luego recogen el cadver como si fuera un objeto sin importncia.-Despues de esto el protagonista sigue cantando e bailando e unos chavales se juntan a el e empiean a bailar con el. Pero nosotros nos fijamos en ellos en el e no nos fijamos que detras de ellos est ocourriendo una  espcie de revolucion e eso significa que hoy en dia no nos fijamos en las cosas mas peligrosas o preocupantes, por lo contrario nos fijamos en tonterias como por exemplo los bailes famosos que eses chavales estan aciendo.-Seguido de esto volvemos a tener un ritmo alegre pero ya sabemos que es alegria falsa. Una vez mas nuestro protagonista se une a los chavales que estan transmitiendo esa alegria falsa pero despues de unos segundos el se da cuenta de la realidad (fijaos en como le cambia la expresion passando de estar alegre a estar srio) e coje un arma e los mata a todos e vulve el bajo de antes.-Luego la escena al almazn e esta vez esta mas lleno de gente e hay mas revuelta e mas caos. Pero si os dais cuenta ese caos esta desfocado e el protagonista e los chavales no lo estan (una vez mas no le damos importancia a la realidad)-En esta parte del vdeo la letra dice "" Im on gucci..... im so pretty) aqui se est criticando a todas las personas que solamente se precupan con su fsico pensado que son en cenro de atencion._ No muchos segundos despues vemos a unos chavales que estan grabando con sus mobiles la revuelta que esta ocurriendo en el almacn, criticando claramente a la gente que quando ve por exemplo a una persona siendo atacada por un perro se pone a grabarlo e luego lo sube al las redes, em vez de ir a ayudar a la persona.-Unos segundos despues los chavales forman una espcie de circulo al rededor del protagonista e por detras de ellos pasa un caballo banco con alguien vestido de negro encima. Esse caballo es una refncia al ginete del apocalypsis que significaria el fin del mundo.-Luego al final del video clip se juntan las dos ""bases"" la alegre con la que da miede (la parte del trap) significando que apesar de todo la sociedad vive en una espcie de equilibrio entre las tonterias e la dura relidad-Por ltimo e no menos importante, tenemos a la que es, en mi opinion, la mejor escena donde podemos ver al protagonista corriendo e podemos ver que tiene una cara de pnico e fijaos ( no me llameis racista) en como hay un momento en el que el se v muy negro e quando sale a la luz podemos ver que est siendo perseguido siendo todos ellos, probablemente, de piel blanca. Esto nos quiere transmitir que aun en los dias de hoy los negros aun son perseguidos por la raa blanca.Aqu est todo lo que la cancion e este video clip nos quiere transmitir, en pocas palabras, quieren que despertemos para el mundo REAL e no nos quedemos en la ignorncia.Ante todo pido disculpas por si hay alguna falta de ortografia porque soy potugus e nunca eh escrito en espaol. Espero que os aya servido de ayuda.Gracias e saludos desde Portugal!!",1

(Children in America follow whatever celebrities do and donÕt pay attention to whatÕs happening in America all round them. They just look at the bright side of everything and smile, no reacting to the world around them).1:25 - Gambino says, ÒIMÕA GO INTO THIS.Ó While a white blonde girl in the background runs in the mob. She runs in the opposite direction of everyone else running the other way. (White people and black people have different views)1:29 - A white chicken (white person) and a colored chicken (colored person)  are eating together (getting along) -instead of fighting in a chicken fight. They donÕt move.(White people and colored people can get along in all this chaos in America even if people expect us to fight).1:50 Gambino walks into a building with a church choir singing. (The church that had a shooting massacre) He goes from happy & dancing to standing still and sad (BiPolar disorder representing the active shooters who have psychological issues) Shoots everyone. 1:56 - An AK is thrown to Gambino. The church choir gets shot. TheyÕre all black. Only 1 cop car shows up to crime scene.  (Black people can get their hands on guns easily. AKÕs are imported Russian Automatic - how do they get into America? How do they get into black peopleÕs hands?. Russia is predominantly white, a white-made automatic gun shoots an entire black choir and all their is is riots & the one cop car means America barely does anything about it.2:05 - Song says ÒThis is AmericaÓ A whole black church choir was just shot. Gambino walks forward. A mob of people run as if coming from the building door opening. (AmericaÕs innocent people get shot & America consumers donÕt care but theyÕll mob into stores on BLACK Friday to fight each other for shit they donÕt need.)2:15 - a white person in a white shirt jumps off the second story. A person yells at him after as if making him in anger.(This represents anger of people against white Americans)2:15 - song says ÒIÕm so fittedÓ while nicely fitted people run & mob by in nicer clothes. (A play on BLACK Friday shoppers & even thoÕ American innocent people are dying people just care about their clothes)2:19 - song says ÒIÕm so prettyÓ Gambino impersonates a girl. Children are back and imitating him. Amongst chaos.(This represents most women in America just worry about how pretty they are, regardless of innocent Americans getting shot. Children imitate celebrities and this social ignorance.)2:30 - song says Òon my KodakÓ children in masks staring at their phones - All sitting casually and comfortably. Maybe theyÕre filming, marble theyÕre just on Instagram. ThereÕs a fire happening behind them.(Kodak is referring to multiple things like Kodak cameras- New generation films everything & Represents millennials in America and how they all just sit back and donÕt care about the chaos in America. They just care about whatÕs on their phone screens even if something important, like a fire, is happening right behind them. Also represents how our new generation sits behind and screen with no real face for their voice, or how this new young generation hides, Òwears a maskÓ behind a screen.)2:36 - a black rider on a white horse runs across the floor from flames, in the direction the cop is facing.(The Bible reference- book of revelation- angel of Death is coming)2:47 -Gambino freezes in the pose of pointing a gun, as if the life is drained out of him compared to his previous dancing. There is no gun tho. People disappear. It gets quite. A women screams.(He doesnÕt really have any gun represents how if a black person just makes a gun gesture he is treated as if he has a real gun. Him freezing represents his life being taken away- Black people getting shot by police or Americans even if they donÕt have guns.2:54 - GambinoÕs eyes open. Completely silent. He lights a joint. Red lighter.(Open your eyes. His eyes go close with chaos, and open in a peaceful place - Represents his death and peace after. Death in America. Death for him. Death for innocent people who died in America. Joint represents calm and peace and relaxation in the next world. Red lighter is red for blood, death and pain in America)  3:09 - camera swings across Trayvon MartinÕs Dad is playing guitar. Head still covered. (His Dad was shot earlier so how is he back? HeÕs back because Gambino is now in Heaven here. This Represents Trayvon Martin in heaven at peace. Head still covered represents shame, shame in America for allowing him to die with no real respect for him.3:10 Gambino walks from the floor up to on top of a red car. (Goes from a lower place to a higher place- represents that this place is heaven. Red represents blood.) 3:16 Gambino throws joint. Dances with smile . Trayvon MartinÕs Dad in scene playing guitar.(Throwing joint represents him not needing a peace from weed because heÕs in heaven here. Trayvon is in heaven. Trayvon inspiring Gambino still even thoÕ he is in heaven. Gambino is happy in heaven.)3:21 - hot girl sitting on car gets in view.(Angel, beauty, love in heaven) 3:46 - song says Òjust a black man in this worldÓ Gambino is running as if for his life. (Black people in AmericaÕs struggle in America. Feeling as if they have to struggle for their life in America)3:57 GambinoÕs eyes wide open.(Open your eyes)This is America.",1

27916,"He played the role of america itself blind to all of the violence and injustices towards black people, caring more for guns than human life, and using pop culture to distract the masses. He played the black man as a puppet, participating in helping distract the masses, killing other black people, and pushing a narrative of being young and not caring about whats going on. Those 2 chains symbolizes bondage as well as a thirst for status. The scene where he shoots the choir he was america. He came in dancing along with them and then suddenly snapped out of it as if realizing he was not with them and then shot them down with no emotion took special care of his gun and then walked past an oncoming riot like he didnt even notice. This man is a genius.",1

27936,"Bad music is a form of murder to the true art of music in general.Bad music forced on a child is abuse because it invariably forms that child«s taste in music. Bad music has raped an industry that was held up strongly by great expression for decades but now finds itself floundering, giving in to the lowest common denominator of music just to keep its panties around its waist. Bad music tortures the eardrums and kills little bits of your senses through prolonged exposure. Bad music steals money from shallow pockets, steals airtime from more deserving bands and songwriters, and steals the spotlight from undiscovered geniuses who have all but given up on a dream because of the mediocrity of popular radio. Bad music is a lie, and yet it is foisted on the public in an attempt to turn melodies and songs into hamburgers and fries. Bad music is truly a sin because you don«t have to be exceptional to make it in the music industry anymore. You just have to be good enough to stick around and be tolerated. I understand that bad music is a matter of opinion. I know that. But I am fairly confident that more people agree with me than you suspect.Bad music is just fucking bad",1
27937,This song honestly sucks,1
27938,"Why the hell is there so much hate in the comments sections? This entire fucking song has to do with America and how messed up it is and itÕs ongoing problems with racism. ( and thatÕs just facts ______________ tbh ) And when other countries come complimenting the song, saying they like it, and that theyÕre a fan of Gambino, Americans respond with something straight up fucking rude or racist?

Our media and government may be perpetuating all these issues but it only works because they keep us distracted (dancing behind Donald, filming riots on phones) and chasing the symptoms of the problem (riots with police). Once we actually turn on the TRUE perpetrators of this world (start chasing Donald, aka America, instead of cops) thatÕs when theyÕre fucking terrified because they start to lose their power.",1

Not to badmouth your country, because I too would believe so if I never traveled, read about other countries and were told we're the shit since elementary. Just look towards, Canada, scandinavia (3 countries), the netherlands, switzerland. The world is so full of oppertuneties, and the countries just mentioned were olny the once were you live really really good. Hell, go to thailand. Everything there is inexpensive as hell. To live the 'american dream' you either gotta have a big ass, do trap or work your ass off. Fuck up 3 times, and you could basically blow your brains out... sorry for coming out hard.

28032,"Shots fired! I think itÕs okay that we all perceived this song/video differently. ÒThis is AmericaÓ. The country we live in is becoming so out of touch with life. And no it isnÕt just the younger generation. WeÕre distracted by shit that wonÕt shift our lives in a better direction. We are more concerned with whoÕs beefing on L&HH, when Cardi B & Offset getting married, and whatÕs the next trend, we overlook the real. ThereÕs more ppl thatÕll break they neck to go see Beyonc or stand in line for the JÕs than attend a wealth seminar or something that could change your life. We would go broke to get that new Coach bag, those red bottoms, or Ferragamo belt just to take a picture & flex on the gram. Our kids are failing and what are you doing as a parent other than keeping them Polo down or wishing itÕs your kid that goes viral because they can dance. Everyone has a different definition/understanding of what being ÒwokeÓ means. WE have to do more than stay woke. Instead of body shaming someone, attempt to help them lose weight or build some self-esteem. Instead of shitting on someone because theyÕre not fresh, donate something nice to wear. Instead of harping about someone being broke, help them get a job. We have to help ourselves first, but every once in a while, reach out and help someone else. OR STFU. We have to do more than ONLY come together and rage for every Stephon Clark & Michael Brown that gets killed. I donÕt exclude myself from any of this and donÕt crucify me. Sadly, this is the America we live in. And thereÕs no one to turn to for direction, especially our POTUS. DonÕt just stay woke, be conscious & active.",1

Actually a lot of people care.  its the government that doesn't care and if you all cant see that then go with your government and let the real intelligence in this world fix  their mistakes. and the mistakes of all you close minded people.  @Mc HolyLight  you most of all have just shat on this and all you say that its stupid. maybe when you wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and you will see stupid in there. wake the fuck up bud.",1

28214,my guess of what this song is about in my opinion. is calling out peoples delusion in their life of not being realistic with the real problems that are going on and our culture/the new rap is built up on distracting us from the real things now its just about getting your bag. get the strap. get gucci. flex. seem rich to society. while all this real shit is going on in reality we focus on the stupid shit thats promoted to make us think our life is complete and we ok with it. honestly as a society we have dumbed down we went from standing up against so many wrong things to being shut up and fed bullshit to keep us quiet and we ok with it... lmao whats happened to us we have legit become retarded over the past few years.( also i love how he legit took the piss out of our culture at the moment because we have become a joke ),1

28219,"The video is cool, I see it as a theatrical performance piece, but If you just read the lyrics without listening to the music or watching the video the lyrics are really weak. If you listen to early NWA, Tupac, Ice Cube, Public Enemy these guys painted such a graphic image with their lyrics, it's like comparing a novel to a nursery rhyme. Think about it, if NWA,Tupac, Ice Cube, or Public Enemy would have had a video that was this graphic to go with their hardcore lyrics back in the 90's the whole world would have been terrified. It's hard for me to be impressed by ""This is America"" because the lyrics are so soft, and although there are several messages in the video I think it's kinda funny how everybody is over analyzing it and imagining all of these obscure hidden messages. It reminds me of all the religious kooks back in the 70's that were playing Led Zeppelin albums backwards to hear the so called ""hidden satanic messages"". The topic of gun violence in America has been covered by many rap artists, and back in the day even Pearl Jam covered gun violence in schools with the song ""Jeremy"" in 1991.",1

And good shit (expressed by the ÒchoirÓ getting shot is put down & hates on & not funded) Yeah IÕm confused @ how crazy the world works too but all in all peace love, positivity and unity is all we need to embrace, ainÕt it?",1

This art got everyone talking about and discussing the issues going on in the U.S.  Those of you saying the song is shit because he mumbles - that's the whole point. He wanted you to actually listen. People often say they are listening without doing so, and often we are paying attention to the wrong things - which is the point of the video clip. Everything you should be seeing gets covered by his dancing and whacky smile. You can all argue about what each part of the video represents, but everyone will have their own interpretation. That is the whole point.",1
28274,"Just because some black guy makes a song saying this is America and shooting people doesnÕt mean this song is putting out a positive message. You see all these comments saying this was great and was really deep, but in reality if a white man sang this no one would give a shit, itÕs just another black guy and all these liberals are giving to much attention and loving this piece of shit song",1

28294,those suggesting that Kanye's message is similar to what's depicted in this video are confused. Kanye tweeted that slavery was a choice. A statement that is blatantly ignorant and idiotic. Gambino is addressing our cognitive dissonance and attention deficit. Two distinctly different things. Kanye has also demonstrated more and more that he may have some sort of a mental disorder or he's just delusional. He thinks he is some sort of a genius when in fact he is simply a fucking rapper.,1

28326,"See I think the one of the points that he was trying to make here is that now a days we're seeing criminals or future criminals turned into rap icons, and ignore it when they do bad shit cause they make ""good music"". OH and if they do somehow manage to catch a conviction, it only bolsters their reputation, and how in it's current state the Hip Hop community equates being a thug to being talented even though all their sound can easily be recreated as pointed out by Gambino himself in the video. TL;DRstop making stupid shitty people with no talent famous, and giving them a pass on doing fucked up shit because they're famous.",1

28346,What the fuck was that,1
28347,"So this is one theory I know for sure has not been talked about. What if this video is actually talking from the perspective of just black music culturally and how America has shifted that culture? The video starts with an older black woman on the guitar with the old jazzy bluesy sound in the background as soon as Donald Òthe rapperÓ appears he starts dancing cause Òhe just wanted to have funÓ then he shoots the representation of music at that time. He then goes through the warehouse of ÒlifeÓ dancing around and having an awesome time with all the madness. The scene where he shoots the choir can be seen as a double entendre to gun terrorist violence, but also as a death to the soul music in America, listen to the lyrics they arenÕt advanced in soul or lyrics, itÕs modern, the modern death of writing, right? The he still is dancing amidst the chaos, his backup dancers serve as the distraction and why we see kids on their phones. It juxtaposes perfectly at the appropriate time. Then towards the end he sparks the joint says fuck it as gets woke, probably why we see sza as she is seen as a pure form of artist on TDE that keeps the perfect balance of what music was, and where itÕs going. HeÕs running at the end because the mob (America) hates him for it. They Wanna see him Stunting and still dancing going hard his Òget outÓÕ moment, but itÕs not racially, but artistically..",1

28496,"The last scene with SZA and all the cars while he dances to ""get your money, black man"" makes me think:Black men do all this dancing/cooning for white america in order to get money to buy a bunch of cars (that have no value and are bullshit investments) and women. Our black women sit back and encourage it.",1

Nominate him for best spoken word album if you want.",1
28503,"The dancing over horrific scenery reminds me of Ice CubeÕs line from Nigga Ya Love To Hate where he says ÒAnd what I say what I portray and all thatAnd ain't even seen the gatI don't want to see no dancingI'm sick of that shit listen to the hitCause yo if I look and see another brotherOn the video tryin' to out-dance each otherI'm a tell T-Bone to pass the bottleAnd don't give me that shit about role modelÓ And I think in a similar way Glover is saying that America would rather that he (and other artists) focus on fun dances moves and poppy beats rather than actually talking about the problems of our society in its current state. The black community is especially guilty of doing this instead of actually doing something - but in all fairness itÕs everyone across America. So, comments that are like Òthis is AfricaÓ, ÒThis is WakandaÓ, or ÒThis is Black AmericaÓ no. ItÕs just America. ItÕs all of us, and making it only about the black community would be like comparing a few matches to a wildfire that was already there for centuries- then complaining about how your matches were burning.",1

28510,Fixated on making money and distracting ourselves with shit that doesn't matter. Meanwhile kids dieing at school is just everyday news. Escapism through drugs and feeling sorry for ourselves is easier than actually facing the problem.

He doesn't realize how great America is right now and how we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN____________ We have proof that youtube, Google, Twitter, FaceBook etc. skews there ""trending"" lists to make liberal bullshit, like this song, appear more popular and loved than it really is. Guarantee there are more than 150,000 dislikes. He should be on his knees, thanking whatever God he believes in, that Trump is America's President. Chicago, New York City, Baltimore, Los Angelos, Memphis are cities with the highest murder rates for BLACK ON BLACK crime and they have been solely in Democratic hands for DECADES. Oh, and remember, these have been ""gun free"" cities for decades as well. The percentage of black men killed by other black men is 95%.The percentage of black men killed by cops in 2015 was .0004%. But yeah, cops are the problem. Keep seeing the black race as victims Gambino, I choose to see them as victors, but they have to believe it first. Your ""childish"" lyrics and videos are not helping.

Selling drug's, gang bangingÊor kicking in doorsÊon the block isÊNOT a legitimate job. That's the type of activity's that get people killed or locked up in prison. The last I looked, the prison system is slam full of black folk's who were just trying to get that money. Everything I got in this world, I had to work and sacrifice to get, I'll be damned if I let anyone of any color or creed come and just take it. We all have a choice to make in this Country,Êyou don't like drug's in your neighbor hood, stop buying and selling them. You don't like guns in your neighbor hood's, stop buying and selling them. You don't likeÊthe crime rate's in your neighbor hood, stop committing crime. And further more, the white man is not holding down the black folk's, Black folk's are making their ownÊchoice to be where they are in life. Hell, if any one color of people is being held down it is the white folk's, ""affirmative action"" has held me back from getting one of those state highway department job's, because they needed more diversity in there work force.ÊIn other words, if you are not black or brown we don't want you. I don't let that hold me down, because my mind is free from hatred and division. People need to pay more attention to Kanye West, he finally freed his mind and his ass followed. Get off the Government plantation of division and strife people. We all haveÊa common enemy here, Government employee's total control over the freeÊwill of the people. We (myself included)Êare all slave's on their plantation and the slave's are not scared to resist anymore.ÊIf someone doesn't like what I have to say, come see me face to face, I'll square you're ass away.

Of course this song will be a hit, due to mostly liberal people listening to this mainstream type of music, but I just want to say that everyone has their own opinions and their own views, and for you to say that America is faulted due to you not agreeing with different views, then itÕs really sad. More whites than blacks get shot by police every year, but the media never portrays it because itÕs not a good story. Most blacks are living in this fantasy world where everything is shit, when in reality they were born blessed to call themselves and American.

Look at the big picture.  What we are going through right now is nothing. America is in its best spot itÕs ever been in. Maybe we should re arrange our priorities and stop hopping on a political agenda bandwagon to harbor some quick cash and fame. America is far from perfect and racism is a true problem in America that needs to be fixed, but we need to stop being so self centered and help the people who need it so much more than we do",1

African American used entertainment to get out of bondage noticing slaves being treated better for being said entertainment.  (Still fed and even dressed, without hard work. ) it became a cycle where blacks would dance to entertain and comfort themselves while black killings continued.  We had two options jump Jim crow or deadman.  We've been buying into this from Jim crow we have been stagnant since.  Secondly America knows what it's doing. Why? Because it's been getting away with it so long.  Kill some blacks,  make it look like we're doing all the crimes,  dance craze distracts,  all the music is the same,  EVEN UNTIL THIS VIDEO! The reason why the dances distract is because it distracted us since the first boat trip.  our culture  Distracted them from our misery.  Check out J.Coles ATM its  loaded with secret messages.",1

You people eat this like what it truly is, bullshit coated in sugar and lies.

28907,"I came up with two interpretations; one is how I saw it with my own eyes and the other is how I imagine Donald saw it and intended for it to be. CanÕt help but go into the Left/Right paradigm for this, so bare with me; The Left Side might see the Jim Crow portrayal with the moves and facial expressions as the mediaÕs pushing the Òscary nigger with a gunÓ story Ñ and the confederate pants being a creation of the racist whites. The Right side may see instead a black guy, still enslaved under Democratic thought (confederate pants) and in the concrete plantation (maybe Chicago or Baltimore). HeÕs still very Jim Crow but killing other black people, but heÕs quickly transitioning back to the happy-go-lucky dancing and statements of ÒIm so dopeÓ of ÒIÕm so pretty,Ó with the mainstream media saying Òthe Black Guy with a gun isnÕt realÑNever mind the black on black crime.ÓI donÕt think the latter was ever the intended interpretation, and I think thereÕs even more to get into. Aesthetically, good sound and nicely done video all politics aside.",1

The 1st part when he shoots the man is like our government and what they do overseas and abroad to political or religious ""terrorist "" by bullet or bomb.  He shoots the chior such as what the whiteboy did in Carolina but he still dances, talking about money , materialistic stuff like the music these cats are making.  Other words this song emphasize how our music doesn't reflect the times we live in. Our minds is clouded by bullshit .. my opinion what yall think",1

It's like watching fox news, it plays with your mind if you don't open your eyes to it fully. Other bands and artists have been trying to wake people up to this stuff for years but their music isn't ""mainstream"" enough to get air time. Rage Against the Machine, Prophets of Rage, System of a Down, Rise Against, Anti-Flag to name a few. Hopefully this video will start waking more people up to the shit that the media's and governments don't want us to see",1

To earn a profit and I hate how this is how we are portrayed globally. Buts that's what white people allow. Everything else is twice as hard to come up on  and we get little to no spotlight for it. Along with all this other shit like police brutality,  systematic oppression, weapons , drugs , violence in our community. Etc.

28935,"This is basically a literal copy paste of Tyler the Creator's - Who dat boy. The lyrics are fucking garbage, it's just nonsense. and Then there is this really powerful message in the music video, I just can't wrap my brain around why someone who produced ""redbone"" which has a very powerful lyrical meaning comes out with ""this is america"" over and over again with just other nonsense in the lyrics and yes everybody I watched at leas 4 ""interpretation"" or ""breakdown"" videos about the video and song as a whole. There are a few ""messages"" in the lyrics themselves, but beyond that everything is in the video. If you're going to take an opportunity to create a powerful message, why not do it in both mediums? All in all my opinion of this is that Gambino is another Tyler the creator, shock value artist and nothing more. Only time will tell.",1
28936,What that fuck did i just watch?,1

Go to some countries in Africa. You guys have it so good here. We all do.  Pretty hard to get racked up over race when other country's government corruption and terrorism don't care about your skin color and will still fuck you.. If it's not skin color, it's religion, if it's not that it's something else. This isn't American, this is humanity. You all are being lied to and this shitpuppet is just another string of the marionette pushing crap. From a philosophical standpoint, and even more so from an economic perspective, most of you idiots have no idea the near impossibility it would take for humans to cooperate on some utopian level of society.

29001,"So good, so radical it blows out all the things we're supposed to adore and buy into in this sick ass brainwashing culture, ALL of it.

29004,"As a member of the white community i understand this. I think there is so much black on black crime within the community. He is constantly picking up guns and murdering members of his community.  Also the chorus saying ""get your money black man""  is talking about the African american culture of black males within the drug trade  using illegal means to get money then saying ""police are tipping,"" because this statement shows the ignorance behind a person breaking the law and getting caught then blaming law enforcement. Lastly i think people read to much into the dancing as distracting us for the background, i think it is distracting due to the fact you have African Americans in school uniforms and the drop out rate for African American children is super high. So it would be out of place to see that many African students in high school. See how easy it is to make up racist bullshit when looking at art really shows you what kind of place you are coming from.",1

It speaks a lot but I would also like to say to everyone commenting amerikkka and kill all white people and saying Òwe need reparationsÓ chill. Whites are not out to kill you, they donÕt hate you, and weÕre sorry for what happened but itÕs time to grow up and realize that we arenÕt against you anymore.",1

29064,Oh shit what a message,1
29065,"What a work of art. Here's my interpretation: Childish Gambino is sending a massage. He is dancing for the majority of the video and we are entertained and vastly distracted from what is happening in the background. Even the camera focus is on him dancing while the background is slightly blurred. He intended this detail to emphasis how distracted we are and fail to see the rioting and the chaos in the background. (Did anyone else catch the suicide?) That is the reality, ladies and gents. Some were on their phone on the second floor and weren't rioting like everyone else (distraction; how many of us waste time on our phone, social media etc.?) There's a shift when he points up his hands like a gun as if he's imaging what it would be like. We tend to ""only imagine"" what horror a mass shootings is like. We see the news, the snapchats, the daily feed and we are impacted by all the sadness and ""only imagine"". We mourn the tragedy naturally. He lights a joint, his demeanor shifts as he takes a 'moment' from everything. Silence and ones own thoughts can lead us to reflect on how disturbing society is nowadays. But just like Gambino, we continue dancing. Until the people (who were rioting previously) begin to chase him and he runs for his life. (This is also a commentary on slavery. The black man has been running for his life since the beginning of time. We're in 2018 and not much has changed. Why? Let's look at the big picture here.) Why suddenly have they decided to chase him? What have the masses accomplished by rioting and chasing one another, and pointing the finger over there, and blaming them, and him? Nothing. Instead of uniting and CHANGING the rate at which our society is imploding in on itself, we as a humanity must UNITE and bring change to stop all the horrific killings, deaths, police brutality, mas shootings, war etc.. all that has occurred by the hands of man. He's telling us to wake the fuck up.  It's beautiful, it' powerful, it's grotesque..... and that is America.",1
29066,What sexy man __,1
29067,"What I got is this. First the musical style. It ia mimicking a lot of what we hear today with the Kodak Black and this kind of flow, I don't know if Gambino is trying to mock it but maybe. Gambino's dancing is the media distracting us from the fucked shit this country goes through. If you block out Gambino and dancers the background is pure mayhem. There are probs tons of political messages but I noticed the Charleston shooting reenactment and how the cops were there INSTANTLY with clubs. Towards the end I guess it means we don't realize how much trouble our country is in until its too late.",1
29068,donald glover is no doubt fucking amazing,1

It truly feels like brainwashing watching videos these days. But then there is this, this is how you mix art, visually and musically. It is mocking how traditional rappers are and so many other things it would take paragraphs for me to explain my point of view on this. ONE whole continuous shot. I don't think people understand this had to all be done in one take. That mean if you fuck up the last line you have to do the entire thing over. This shit is like poetry in motion. No point and all hook with the lyrics just showing how dumbed down the game has become. It is truly inspiring. Watch it once while watching him and what he does then watch it again and only look at whats happening in the background. He makes it look like it comes easy but I bet he labors over these types of things. The opposite to the mainstream artists.",1

All the shooting, riots, racial profiling and injustice towards blacks has been happening for a very long time. It's just glamorized in this age and the people eat it up. The fact that people talk now because how raw the content of the video is but not when the actual events happen, is down right deplorable. What sucks even more even when blacks follow and go by the system, we get no justice. If we riot, we're just having another ""angry black people"" case. We protest, we're unheard. In all of this we're not taken seriously. We still are considered ""entertainment"" not just for the white man but every other race as well. It's okay to be musicians and sportsmen. Anything else, it's a problem. In the words of Translee: ""The system ain't f-ed up. It's working exactly like it's supposed to."" I don't have to explain what that means.",1

Kanye has sparked the mental revolution..Slavery was a choice.   Many documents talk about the natives not being good slaves in the beginning due to massive rebellion and failure to reproduce progeny in captivity. they did that by choice.we as black people want to hold on to the slave narrative taught to us by our oppressors as it gives us an excuse to entitlement and this wo is me attitude. we hold on to it because we have been misguided about our history. ..did slavery happen? yes...but look up share cropping. and the freedman trust. but 400 years absolutely not. what about the Silver war? yes not civil..we keep each other in slavery by criticizing any black that questions the narrative taught to us by our oppressors..Wake up..its not they we should worry about its 'The  'Y' are we choosing to live in a story and not dominate our own future.",1

It is a message on the state of America, and that's fine, but I see it as a whole over-arching message on the human condition, how we can easily be distracted by all the nice music, and dance moves, but behind that limelight, some shitty stuff is happening. It highlights how all humans just want to find some sort of entertainment. Humans just want to stimulate the brain, nothing more. And THAT fact, is the worst of all.",1

29362,"--- PLEASE READ, HELP & SPREAD THE INFO ---People (including innocent children) are being molested, raped, tortured and killed at the cloning centers. These cloning centers are located in Deep Underground Military Bases. For example, Area 51 (Lincoln County, Nevada), Dulce Base (Dulce, New Mexico) and Montauk Base (Montauk, New York). Most of these bases have a cloning floor and that cloning floor IS a cloning center. Some cloning centers are above ground though. ThereÕs an above ground cloning center somewhere in western Canada, which Queen Elizabeth owns. She knows where the cloning center in Canada is and so does the former Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper. Queen Elizabeth, Vladimir Putin and high-up Chinese people pretty much RUN the cloning centers. In addition, Kevin Sullivan (ex-pro wrestler) is a rich, satanic cloner with a lot of pull with the Illuminati.The Illuminati or New World Order (NWO) have technology that allows them to be able to transfer oneÕs consciousness (or soul) to a Mark 2 REM-driven duplication clone body at the cloning centers (in this dimension) during REM-phase of sleep. They can also transfer oneÕs consciousness to a Mark 3 duplication clone body at the cloning centers (in this dimension) while one is in a meditative state (no REM required). All they need is a blood, tissue or possibly even a DNA sample to make a Mark 2 REM-driven duplication clone of you and they Òcome out"" the same age as when your sample was taken. It takes them around five months or less and it only costs around $30 (for test tubes/maintenance). They can kill anyone remotely from the cloning centers, if they have a clone of you. They can do this (kill your real body) by either applying a constant electrical current to your clone or by torturing your clone. Your real body will die from a heart attack or an aneurysm, the same day or the next day. They are victimizing people all around the world while theyÕre asleep. Some people donÕt recall anything that takes place and some people think the experience is a dream or a nightmare. Additionally, theyÕre deceiving people by making them believe that their experience was a Lucid Dream (or just a regular dream or a nightmare) or Astral Projection (or an OBE aka an Out-Of-Body-Experience). They tell people different things (e.g. that they're in the Astral plane, 4th dimension, 5th dimension, etc.), it depends on the person and what they are more likely to believe. Lucid Dreaming and Astral Projection both take place at the cloning centers (in this dimension). They use clones, MK Ultra and drugs to manipulate and deceive you. YouÕre not having a Lucid Dream and youÕre not in another dimension or in the Astral plane ÒinÓ your Astral body. YouÕre a clone at the cloning centers in THIS dimension, most likely in a MK Ultra scenario. The clones at the cloning centers have a microchip called Mindvoice (also known as Artificial Telepathy or MK Audio Effects) implanted in their head, so they can use MK Ultra (visual and audio effects) on you and to control you. With the use of this chip, they can make anyone see or hear anything. You can even feel (and see) yourself floating, flying, shooting fireballs, etc. but itÕs all an illusion known as MK Ultra visualizations, that only you can see (the people in control know what youÕre seeing though and other people that theyÕre using MK Ultra on, may be able to see as well). They put people in whatÕs called a MK Ultra scenario, which is basically a controlled experience (at the cloning centers) using MK Ultra (visual and audio effects) and drugs. For example, someone flying around fighting monsters, theyÕre in a MK Ultra scenario. They do this (MK Ultra scenarios) for entertainment (e.g. sit back and laugh at the person because they look-like an idiot running around doing whatever), to test them (i.e. to see what one does or how they react in certain situations) and to influence the person (real body) in real life (e.g. make them feel a certain way about someone or whatever, like increasing the likelihood of a girl wanting to go out with someone). Lets say that thereÕs this old man that wants to have sex with this pretty girl at the cloning centers... they can put a MK Ultra visual effect of some celebrity face (that she would most likely be attracted to) over this ugly old manÕs face, so that sheÕd be willing to have sex with him. They use drugs in addition to MK Ultra to help with the manipulation. One may be pre-drugged prior to clone activation (transfer of oneÕs consciousness to a clone) and/or drugged during the experience. One may even find themselves in the same area or room where their real body was sleeping or meditating at. This is not a dream or a lucid dream and you didnÕt project or go out-of-body, you are simply seeing MK Ultra visuals (or illusions) at the cloning centers as a clone. YouÕre in a MK Ultra scenario. When one ""sells their soul"", it means that they agreed for the Illuminati to use a clone of them at the cloning centers for sex (or whatever) while they're asleep in exchange for fame and fortune. In addition, some have Òsold outÓ and joined the Illuminati to receive benefits at the cloning centers (e.g. being able to have sex with celebrities as clones) and/or benefits in real life (e.g. money and fame).Vril type 1 lizards (terrestrial aliens) are parasitic, carnivorous and malevolent. TheyÕre about one to two feet tall. Their head resembles the body of a king crab and their body is covered in red diamond-shaped scales. They dwell underground. TheyÕre dumb (and are able to talk) but smarter when they turn a human into a host (drone). They have a proboscis (called the Quill), which is located on the top of their head. The proboscis (which looks-like a chocolate chip) contains everything that the lizard is (its consciousness). Their lizard body is dead once the proboscis leaves its body. They can only do this once in their lifetime and if they fail (turning a human into a host), they die. The human that is about to be bodysnatched is either unconscious or restrained. The proboscis enters the humanÕs eye and spirals around the optic nerve. It then proceeds to go to an area of the brain (driven by taste) that tastes like butterscotch to them. Then, they do a feeling of holding your breath and pushing outwards. Finally, it does what's called ÒSweating the QuillÓ (at the tip of the proboscis), which excretes the parasitic cells that take over the human body. This kills the human and replaces their consciousness with the Vril lizardÕs consciousness. The Vril lizard becomes that human (after about a monthÕs recovery time).This transition from Vril lizard to human is whatÕs called ""Droning"". Once a Vril lizard becomes a human, they are then known as a Drone, Host of Vril or a Parasited Host. A person that has had this happen to them, may be referred to as someone that had been possessed by a demon. This is what demonic possession is. In addition, some hosts of Vril (drones) call themselves Òwalk-insÓ, in which they describe how an alien consciousness or soul took over their body.The slit-eye videos that you see all over the web are fake. The Illuminati put these out intentionally to mislead everyone into thinking that one can tell who is a ÒreptilianÓ (Vril lizard and a host of Vril aka drone) by checking to see, if their eyes turn to slits. This doesnÕt occur and they cannot do this. However, the eyes ARE one way to tell... Sometimes, there may be an eye that pops outward (or inward) due to the droning process or it makes the eye stray, so it looks-like the person is cockeyed or walleyed. There is no shape-shifting either. The so-called shape-shifting is the transition from Vril lizard to human. Those that talk about Òreptilian shape-shiftersÓ are referring to Vril and people who have been droned.Drones (Parasited Hosts of Vril) mimic human behavior. They are willing slaves with no compassion and only care about droning other people, torture and sex. TheyÕre murderers. They killed the human to ""use"" their body and live life as them... as a human.The Soulstone (also known as a Consciousness Chip or The Soul Catcher) is an apple-seed sized microchip that is capable of holding a flawed recording of oneÕs consciousness. Once a consciousness is recorded on the chip, it is then implanted in a clone body or a real body (which has less side-effects). If itÕs a clone body, they would need to get replacement bodies like every six months to a year (possibly longer). They go to certain military hospitals (like the one near Camp David) to get a new clone. If itÕs implanted in a real personÕs body and turned on, it bodysnatches (kills) the person and whatever consciousness that was recorded on the chip, would then be in full control of that personÕs body. After this is done, that person would then be known as a Chiphead. However, if someone dies and that Òdead consciousnessÓ was recorded on the chip and then implanted, they would then be known as a Dead Chiphead (also known as a Reanimated or an Undead Chiphead). They can implant the chip by drilling a hole in a persons head or they can remove oneÕs eyeball and insert the chip with a rod to a certain depth in the brain (the hyper thalamus region). Then, they simply turn it on and it bodysnatches the person via technology as opposed to a Vril lizard that bodysnatches one parasitically. It messes up the person for like a month or something. They can only sleep, get-up and eat. In addition, they have to have a nurse with them. Dead Chipheads are: gay or bi-sexual (not that thereÕs something wrong with that), evil, theyÕre mentally impaired, they have a ÒhandlerÓ, theyÕre child molesters and sometimes they want to bite, eat or kill people. This is because the technology to Òbring them backÓ (from the dead) is flawed and cannot be fixed.",1

I cant form any thoughts off of what he's saying, its all gibberish. He drew words from a hat and lined them up in the order drawn and thats how he wrote the lyrics. This isnt even a song, hes saying gibberish over a fucking beat made in GarageBand. This is literal fucking trash.",1

29397,"I love America and I will stand behind Trump until his term is over and over the last year or two I have really been disconnected with the art world. Mostly all of the celebrities tweet how they think what Americans should say and think, And I've just gotten to the point to stay away from social media and other shit where my mind can't be polluted by the garbage that people are feeding other people. But, say what you want about Kanye West's latest outings but I really honestly think he started a revolution for the free minds. I may be totally wrong but honestly, this song by Childish Gambino may have started the construction of the blue prints. I really have been restrained on calling certain songs that come out today art but, I think this may be Gambino's masterpiece. Art can be interpreted in so many ways but I honestly don't think this song is one sided on the political spectrum like some people may think. Police brutality exists and I won't deny it but, there's so much more forms of violence, hatred, and racism that flows through the nation. Blacks killing blacks, fear of cops, fear of being shot up anywhere you go and these fears should not be going through our mind where ever we go. The sad thing is how much we dance around the real problems and make the most pointless and the most stupidest shit, top headlines. We point fingers at other people instead of pointing at ourselves.

Not only racism to African Americans but also Hispanic people. So much white privilege .. I'm sorry to say this but since history the white men always have been selfish. They stole land that wasn't and killed so many people who didn't do shit to them. I can't believe it's 2018 and this hasn't changed at all. It really sucks to not feel safe in the streets because you know for being in the wrong place at the wrong time you can get hurt or end up dead. I just wish things would change like racism, gun violence, police brutality, and our fucking corrupt government who don't care about shit just the money they receive.

Is it because those 17 kids were mostly well to do white people, and those 69 young people were all black poor people? Seems to me that white people really don't give two fucks about how many black people die, as long as it doesn't affect them. And black folks don't seem to want to address this either. All they seem to care about anymore is Cops that kill their own. Peace is bad for politicians and business. Our country is fucked up, but all the sheeple want to pick a side, and our government(city, state, and federal) just divides us more and more, and nobody seems to care!",1

29527,"Maybe I live in a utopia that shields me, but some of these ideas hold no weight, to me. In real life interaction, I can't see much of any racial divide. For the police and black citizens, most of the big name cases have not been police brutality, but offenders not cooperating with the police. This isn't to say police brutality isn't an issue, but it isn't been reported or shown by anyone, including those supposedly being effected. Next is violence in general. Overall, crime is absolutely down and standards of living and prosperity are the highest they have ever been in human history. This isn't to say there isn't room for growth, there absolutely is, but it's almost as if people are making this time to be the worst that has ever been. One huge aspect that I think this video was black on black violence. Yet even as I mention that, many are ready to condemn me. There is a *serious issue* with black culture and America's overall obsession with media and entertainment. These oversexualize women, condone drugs, crime, guns, having ""pride,"" excess money, and not taking shit from anyone. That's the problem. Why promote these horrid ideals? It's so backwards. This video is a lash against black culture and yet no one is pointing it out. Stop focusing on dance moves, who is cheating on who, getting ""bitches,"" etc. and start reading, studying in school, working on goals that take **years** to achieve. Obviously this can't be be done without government help. We need to give schools with areas like this *immense* funding so that we can help children get food, a safe place to study, opportunities to learn, and turn away from this current culture celebrating hardship and ""evil"" deeds. As for gun control, guns save more lives than kill. Again, like I stated with crime stats, the stats show the lives saved *overwhelmingly* exceed those lost due to guns. And not only lives saved in that moment, via shooting the perp or just brandishing, but the lives of the kids those saved people will have. Guns, crime, drugs, etc. won't be an issue if people's needs are met. They turn to these sources as solutions when the think they have no more options. Give people incentives to turn away from this shit via a structure that puts down the ""bad"" actions and promotes these ""good"" traits, and people will.",1

Blaming cops (the only protection that they have from their own violence unleashed by fellow blacks which is around 98% of all violent acts) and some mythical 'institutional racism' for everything gone wrong with their lives even decades after civil rights laws were passed and not recognize how their social structures/families are destroyed by the left for decades without being able to generate social capital and used only as a vote banks by the lefty black/white politicians/leaders of the democrat party (slave owners) continue to steal and live off of the handwork of millions of other Americans and disingenuously blame the Republicans, the party of Lincoln  (who fought against slavery)!.

The whole singing is about how we want to see the world, how it's so perfect and the best, but it's actually crumbling and everyone is doing their best to ignore it, not fix it. Everyone is trying to simply live on in America but we aren't fixing shit, which is where the issues are. When we try to force acceptance, we somehow become about prejudice again and the cycle just grows. We need guns, yes. But we need them because guns exist. We trapped ourselves with the instruments we are supposed to use for defense. What I love most is how this man, beautiful artistic talent btw, is willing to lay it out for what it is.",1

But the issue wonÕt be dealt with until Jesus come back as it says in Matthew wickedness will increase when the son of man return and you can see it.

You are a Man or a Woman. Racism shouldn't exist, it is 2018 and our civilization has been fighting this stupid form of labeling people since the beginning of time. Blacks,Whites,Mexicans, etc all experience hateful racism. Open your eyes, Racism is just another way for the government/big wigs to keep its people down. Instead of fighting and challenging their power we are killing each other and arguing over things that we shouldn't be. This song and its message is so deep!

Black lives matterÓ All lives matter. ThereÕs not just black and white. There is Tan people. And no they arenÕt Òlight skinnedÓ they are tan. Unless you are a mixture of white and black but hispanics are usually just tan. As i was saying, those bad people make innocents look bad so cops will be unfair w those who arenÕt doing anything wrong bc of the others who did. Yes, white people will get white privilege SOMETIMES but bc this is Òtheir countryÓ (false statement) it belongs to those who were here first but now it belongs to anyone who helps this country grow so if latinos/hispanics and black people and asians help, it is their country too. But how ab we talk ab that?Black people ainÕt the only ones getting discriminated. Hispanics are too. Obviously. Calling all hispanics ÒmexicansÓ is just ignorant. ItÕs like saying all asians are Chinese. So like, how ab we like support and talk ab how we can stop blaming innocents for the wrong of others making the whole ÒcommunityÓ look bad. White people done bad shit too but theyÕll still trust them w anything.

Fake ass shit produced for the masses and call it Music and freedom.  About the bands, and shootings prevelant through out the video... thatÕs apparently America now and thatÕs what noooobody else is getting across. Seems completely satirical but it isnÕt. Mumble rap, money talk, strap talk... letÕs think about all the old bullshit we got through, all the dumb mistakes people before us did and how some artists use there words to propetuate a false sense of reality.... How many of us live in a place ravaged by poverty? IÕll raise my own hand to that. How many of us struggle because or ignorance? IÕll raise my own hand on this one too... even though my skin looks white I whole heartedly say I am Anishinabe and I grew up on the Rez my Great grandma lived and died on as well as my Grand Pa. Will we ever see a peaceful America? Probably not, too many opinions and not enough dialogue between us all. I propose a selection of people, two from each state, to come as humans, discuss hard topics. And itÕs all live streamed. ThereÕs no meet and greet, two people from each state and they all can interject on modern music, politics, history, technology, faith, sexuality and itÕs all streamed uninterrupted. We as a nation of randomly chosen people come together. ThereÕs a couple comedians to open about war, hate, politics, and whatever they want to talk about and they laugh donÕt laugh, want to be chosen. To speak freely as free humans on this one piece of refuge amongst all the odds weÕre causing amongst ourselves. Troy aka T-Bone... Mr. Stir up something to make humans think again.... Mr. Donald Glover.... we as Americans would watch, it needs refining but it would be a place where we as a nation could actually have a voice and be heard and known. True democracy at its purist. Just an idea but if you even give a shit about this Earth and your fellow humans use the gift you have and run with it. ThereÕs a giant looming amongst ourselves and we need to hear everything from everyone to come together as people... for all this mess to be sorted. Just a old Veterans opinion on what your song and video had to say about America. I assume you wonÕt read this or take me seriously and itÕll be hard but, the people will know and itÕll be somehow a informative way We as Humans can collectively be one. IÕm completely against monetization of this as this can be a way we as a Collective group of people come together and work as one.",1

29859,"guess what? you're all right. it's a symptom and it's a disease. this song is american. this song is african, I mean how could there be an America today without African lives? yes, black people kill black people where black people live. white people kill black people too. and lock them up, taking time away, which is tantamount to life.yes black people (humans in general REALLY) should and can do better, but alot of what affects that is what happens to children. adults are supposed to get over things they endured when they were younger, still learning the world, but how many times have told a crying a baby not to worry and got them to instantly pucker up and smile? imagine your life without your mom or your dad? would you be the same person you are today? some people don't have either, have no family at all. it has an effect, and to try and deny that is insanity.Kanye West recently said slavery is a choice, once that statement is out there it's up to us to either be small, average, or transcendent with our thoughts about it. if you're thinking small, you'll focus on Kanye and talk shit about crazy people because you're focusing on the PERSON. If you'll think a little grander, you'll focus on the event he was talking about in question, how he worded himself insensitively, and you'll recall the pain and legacy attached the slavery in America because you're focused on the EVENT, but if he sugar-coated his words, you wouldn't think about it at all, and wouldn't have engaged in open brutal discussion.If you are grand, and zoom in on the IDEA, you'll recognize that it trickles down to the similar EVENTS throughout history and the PEOPLE they have affected. if you are a slave financially, physically, or mentally, do you think you'd be able to walk out of it unscathed? do you think you'd ever feel comfortable living in a country that once considered you subhuman? maybe you can say you would be ok, but what about your parents? your grandparents? what if you are jewish, and had to hear Holocaust deniers tout their shit? or if you lost a child to one of our many Mass shootings and had to hear someone say ""it was staged"" while you mourn your child?this is what it comes down to. tragedies like slavery and genocide have been happening forever and they have lasting impacts. but you are not here forever. so are you going to bitch moan and complain about what happened in the past, or are you going to do something with your future? by all means, never forget what your ancestors have done for you, but take that America and do something with it in return.This is America. Freedom is possible here. Just ask Harriet Tubman. For her, SLAVERY WAS A CHOICE, and for her and many other she chose to be a slave no more. Debate me on that. Yes, some bad shift went down, now do something about it. Actions speak louder than words. For Malcolm X, being a slave mentally was a choice, and he said NO. Think for yourself, and do not let yourself be controlled and distracted by something as trivial as media, especially if you do ( or don't) know who controls it, or what their interests are. Unless you count yourself as part of the masses and not a unique individual, then understand you are subscribing to every ideology in the world, on both sides of every fence and the damn fence itself. Be you, recognize people in this world would be perfectly fine having you worked for their dreams, and decide if you'd rather work for your own. And you've only got one life. Your parents gave that to you to do what YOU want with it, not someone else. They will try to kill you, your hopes, your dreams, your love, your ambition, your lineage, your pride, your confidence. They will try to write off your fears, your anxieties, your rage, snuff our your flame, and have you retire quietly into the night. So go make your legacy. And get what you decide you are worth and are owed not from man, but from the world.",1

We think we own it because we created it, but the ""thug"" style and the stupid dance moves have been biting us in the ass for ages. white people have been using the aura weve adopted as an excuse to lable us as high threat and continuing to perpetuate the ""agressive black man"" stereotype.

If your not on the left your an alt right Nazi it seems. If your not a crazed liberal then good, don't get indoctrinated into this bullshit and keep supporting America.

30035,"That horse in the background? Look up ""selective attention test"" on YouTubeSpoiler: it's a group of people passing a ball around when at some point a guy in a gorilla costume crosses in the background. The point is that most people focus on what the video is showing in the front and not in the backI think the horse is white with a black masked figure on top because of Revelations. It's the familiar quote: ""I heard as it were the noise of thunder. One of the four beasts saying 'come and see,' and I saw. And behold, a pale horse. And his name that sat on him was Death. And Hell followed with him""So while we're all watching the black people dance in the front we may not see some big shit happening in the backSuch a haunting freaking video",1

How about the fact that Americans are gonna lose their 2nd amendments cuz some Americans don't like firearms? What about all of your tax money that is being sent overseas to help fund terrorist groups like ISIS?? Make a song that Addresses REAL ISSUES IN AMERICA instead of hopping on this boring ass ""Political Correctness"" Bandwagon that so many celebrities are already joining?? It's sad that a non-American individual like myself can be able to see the real issues in America than most Americans who are ""woke"". America is a fucking joke!",1

30049,"Really liked the editing, it gave the video a feel of continuity that matched well with the subject of the song. Curious about the cut just after he lit up a joint. Interesting video, I just wish the single had the gunshots in it because that shit hit me in real life.",1

30065,I don't know what I love more the comments going in depth about the video and actually appreciating the art that it is. Or the triggered butt hurt comments. lol how can u be so naive and ignorant?,1
30066,"When he says ""This Is America"", he's talking about literally, this video is a representation of America. He couldn't be more clear.Throughout the video, Gambino and the children dancing is in the forefront while chaos is in the back. I think it represents how black culture is glorified while black communities are in dismay.At 1:55, after he shoots the choir, there is a police car, but everyone running to the scene is holding a weapon above their head. None of them are police officers.At 2:43, he holds a fake gun, and everyone runs away as if he's actually armed. There's fear on the kids' faces.At 3:15 when Donald is smoking a J and dancing on a car, all the cars' blinkers are blinking, like an earthquake or some major disturbance just hit. I think him dancing, the dead black man playing, and the sexy black girl represents black people just keeping on through the dismay.",1
30067,"This is America. We go day by day worried about how we look, how many favorites we get, how many followers we've got, but look over the fact that we have the most prisoners per capita. We look over the fact that our police may be poorly trained. We look over our continued war against terrorism. There's real shit going down every second, but we don't give a damn. That's the message, or at least my interpretation. The lyrics and the video go hand in hand. It's not just about the black community and how badly America, and we are as a nation are divided, but just how shitty our country is turning into and its right under our noses but we just don't seem to care. We've become immune to all of the violence, lies, fake news, murders, guns, mental health. All of it together is the issue.",1

30078,At first I didnÕt even notice all of that going on in the background. Literally my eyes were just on his dancing. Then after watching it again I noticed everything.

What I am seeing is that everyone wants to bitch about how bad shit is, but no one goes to city Council Meetings, and no one Votes!!. We need to unify, not put out Division Tactic Videos.

Also another thing, He straight up murders individuals playing music and singing what I interpret to link to african, and african american music.

30183,I love scrolling through the comments and seeing all these Americans not realise the point of the vid and argue with people who do. This is supposed to be enlightening to not just America but the rest of the world as it shows racism and abuse and suicide but we're all too busy getting caught up in trends and stupid shit or recording this type of shit without doing anything. This is deserving of multiple awards because of the message it sends. We all need to WAKE THE FUCK UP and do something.,1
30184,nigger monkey trash,1
30185,"Since people like making up theories about the video, IÕll join in. What if this was all an act put on by a black bloodthirsty man going out on a rampage against other black people who are innocent and uses the excuse ÒThis Is AmericaÓ to justify his actions and lead everybody into chaos in response to his excuse? Civilians copying his actions and the authorities trying to stop them. Notice how a man plays the guitar at the beginning and end of the video, even though the guy was supposedly killed. What if theyÕre both in on it and use the chaos around them to profit with drugs, cars and women, hoping no-one would notice? Then in the end the man who started the chaos is running away from the authorities because they realised he was responsible for the deaths of the innocents. This was all a plan to start some shit and get something out of it.",1

30196,Only shit,1
30197,Nigga it's a show and you're in it but you don't know. That's why he poked his head out to the center of the screen to break the fourth wall as if he was directly talking to you. Also to simplify matters this whole setup is like s carnival distracting you to the fact you're in a big ass factory and everything in it is what keeps it going. Kind of like a lab experiment lmao. Everybody's lab rats,1
30198,This song sucks,1
30199,Is this supposed to be music? Im must be officially old now because this just sounds like noise with a dude talking utter shit over it.,1

The America in the real world is one hell of a place to live in, and everyone living in America has it better than 99% of people on the planet. Way to add to the clusterfuck Gambino, how edgy you are at fucking 40... Jesus, this is pathetic. You want to see actual rioting? Go to Venezuela, see what true chaos means. Also, love the diversity in this video. Apparently it's only white artists who get crucified if they don't have enough black dancers. This shit goes both ways.",1

30214,I fucking love this video!! __,1
30215,"This is Pillow talk, bitch",1
30216,So watching the visuals of this videos. The interpretation I received is that This is America meaning that this is a country that ignores gun violence and domestic terrorism. And as long as you got some catchy dance and repetitive ass hook that yall call a song. It keeps the masses blind from all the violence.,1
30217,Everyone in the comments trying to decypher hidden messages n shit,1

30224,This shit is hot!,1
30225,This is the most heavy-handed shit I have ever seen. Appeals perfectly to the simpleminded masses.,1
30226,"I might be the only guy who thinks this but the lyrics show the hypocrisy of radical black groups. They claim to be working toward peace, but they themselves arenÕt helping places like Detroit where crime and death is the norm. They then blame all these bad things on the police and how they need tighter security, but when they either have to fire shots when violence was initiated by the criminal they label the government and white people as the people responsible. Of course, there are many instances in which police have opened fire onto those who cooperate and that is absolutely unacceptable, but when shots are fired there is usually a reason. They then blind themselves by saying America is the one going down the dumps and the government should take care of these places. Thing is, they are and the people who live in such places like Detroit arenÕt getting jobs. When the media and celebrities get on their side, it gives even less of an excuse for places to be so bad since they could donate to charities to help these cities. The visuals express how Donald Glover is lookin good despite the chaos around him. Donald signifies how radical black groups are Òmoving America for the betterÓ but they ignore the shit that goes down in the worst cities in America. Idk, thatÕs just what I think.",1
30227,"I genuinely hated his__ he looked like a fuckin pedophile or some shit like that xD like he was insane and the song was so repetitive it hurt xD the beats good but the lyrics,dancing,acting,and editing all suck",1
30228,"I'm surprised no one has mentioned he's pretty much clowning all the rappers he has featured on this song. ""This is your flow"" ""Contraband contraband contraband"" ""I'm so cold like, I'm so dope like yeah"" ""this is all y'all rap about"" and then he has guys like 21 savage, migos, young thug doing the ad-libs __ He's also clowning the whole generation of ignorant youths who listen to this shit and are too busy turning up to trap music to even notice what's really going on in America. ""This is America"" - A bunch of dumbed down kids partying for the gram and Snapchat. ""I'm so pretty"" ""I'm gone get it"" .. then young thug chimes in and says he just checked his following list. They're clowning themselves __",1
30229,"This shit has so many levels, from the symbolism to the message and him actually carrying it out. There's at least 4 other rappers that are gunna be credited based ad-lib, I love this shit",1
30230,"Honestly haven't felt compelled to listen to rap since dude came out. Feel it's because he isn't fake, it hasn't been like this really since Biggie imo, but fuck my opinion.",1
30231,Wheres the rest? Theres more shit wrong . This is like the Netflix of music videos,1
30232,"Rapped like shit and danced like a annoying flamboyant fag. You know the majority of black death's from firearms is done by black people.

30233,"Just watch the video and enjoy it, then watch it again and see what you didn't pay attention to(the things you didn't notice).  You get an understanding that everyone parading around in front of you is a distraction for what is going on in the background.  He is saying this is how america is.  They give you bullshit to pay attention to while they work they real bullshit in the background and get what they want. Just giving yall a simple breakdown.",1

30244,Damn...this shit is DEEP yo!!!,1
30245,So i hate rap...but this shit was pretty METAL!,1
30246,"Are you guys just making shit up? Saying the video has a really deep meaning. I watched the background very carefully and other than crazy shit going on nothing is really happening.Other than there are criminals who do bad things but you don't really see it because you don't hang out with criminals and that you're busy watching people dancing?",1
30247,How in the fuck does this video have 44k dislikes??...I don't get it,1
30248,Cool shit,1
30249,"In the beginning we see a man peacefully strumming his guitar. Then America (which I assume is portrayed by Childish Gambino) begins dancing while the guitar strums a beat. Throughout the video we see chaotic things such as gun violence, robberies, discrimination, etc going on. Gambino shoots up a gospel group, which I assume is a reference to the Charleston Church shooting in 2015. Everytime he shoots someone, the gun is cradled and taken away carefully while the bodies are left or careless dragged away, showing American respect for the second amendment but not for the people disadvantaged by it. While heÕs committing these awful crimes like gun violence him and the group of teenagers behind him continue dancing and smiling like there is no fuck to give in the world. I think the overall moral of the video is that America has flaws but chooses to disregard them and focus on being cool, while the reality is, is that it is being torn apart. This is why he repeatedly says ÒIÕm so coldÓ, and why thereÕs a guy in the background throwing money around, because we care more about being cool, than we do about our society slowly destroying us... IÕve watched this video too many times on replay. And IÕve been left very very concerned on what might be happening in the background of America. I know I canÕt really do shit about it, but it worries me. Amazing job Donald Glover thank you for opening my eyes more. #StayWoke",1
30250,Those kids got some lit fucking dance moves damn.,1
30251,Its sad that we only see problems with america through fucking music videosÉ,1

30253,This is the best music video IÕve ever seen holy shit,1
30254,"He got the title wrong.  It should be ""This is Chicago.""  Everyone has a choice to break free from this kind of bondage to violence and drug addiction.  Time for real men in the hood to grow up and take responsibility for the kids they father, loving their woman like Christ loved the church and we'll see a lot of the hell holes people live in in America clean up.  What a sad waist of such talent to preach such meaninglessness.",1

30275,How does this shit have 100 mil veiws,1
30276,"I sort of like the message of this song but the lyrics are fucking terrible. At least compared to a song like ""l'm not Racist"" - Joyner Lucas which l think is about a 1000x better. If you heard this song on the radio and couldn't see the video it would be practically nothing. It's a song or a rap so the meaning should mostly be in the lyrics but they're almost entirely repetitive, nonsensical bullshit. You wouldn't be sure if the message was gun violence is wrong and it's a huge problem in America or black people from the ghetto are shallow fools.",1
30277,"This song is garbage. He has the same rapping rhythm formula that every mumble rapper uses right now, nothing great about the beat also. When it started, I thought it was going to be original, like Glover normally is. Very disappointed. The only reason people are all over his shit is because this video depicts black persecution in the US, as depicted by a black man. Easy enough move to make everyone think he's a genius for something that has been in discussion for the last several years.",1
30278,So is no one gonna talk about the fucking shootings that were going on,1

30287,whats with the uncredited thugger and 21 ad libs? respect for not cashing that shit in,1
30288,This shit is deep and I can't shake the reality of it..,1
30289,"at the beginning of the song people are rioting just the same as each part of the song,  but gambino and his backup dancers do a great job of distracting from it, but it becomes more noticeable each verse until he himself is amidst the chaos. but it's also worth noting that he himself commits the same violence that worsens between verses, and the rioting, while constant through the video becomes progressively worse as he (an idol) promotes violence. or maybe he just creates cyclical shit because it's weird and it draws people who like thinking their right (an overarching theme of his comedy show ""weirdo""). there's a lot to break down, but whatever the theme is, you're not gonna find it in the comments section.but that's not gonna stop people from just saying it's deeper meaning that supports their pretentious worldview.",1

Maybe in Africa where they have an AIDS epidemic, people still being bought and sold in slavery and no food or water. Or maybe go to China where you have no voice. Move to Canada and watch their socialist country collapse under the deadbeats that leave America. Bitch all you want but in the end we have it amazing. Fuck your manufactured outrage and get the fuck out. BTW this ""artist"" if you can call him that, sucks. I think he was terrible and had nothing original. Just another round of a bitch crying even though he has a privileged life. And the other countries that think they have it better? Take a real hard look at yourselves lol.",1

30323,"Gambino this song is trash. I love your music but this is fucking retarded. Not in a good way. This as about as good as ""gucci gang"" from lil xan.",1
30324,This is fucking sick!!!!!,1
30325,My take on this is that the black youth is so focused on the hottest dances and the social media bullshit that we disregard the real problems in our community until it comes knocking at our door. He dances throughout the whole video as crazy things continue to escalate and he remains unfazed until the problems come knocking at his door and then he is the only one running. All the kids dancing with him disappear.. I think that just shows how unconcerned we are with others problems until itÕs happening to us!,1
30326,"I hate how the hip hop culture is represented in Mainstream rap these days with garbage mumble rap and untalented kids with shitty face tattoo's, but even from my jaded perspective I can see that this is a very important music video with a very strong message that needs to be heard.Music may be dead, but artistic expression is very much alive and well.",1

30498,What a fuckin faggot,1
30499,"I think this song is more about complacency and the closed-mindedness of america above else. instead of doing so much as to even discuss the issues we're dealing with peacefully[poverty, violence, intolerance, political instability, etc.] and come up with solutions & compromises, instead people are just telling others to shut up and go back to entertainment, drugs, celebrity bs, hedonism and what not. It's gotten to a point where we care more about products than people, when scandals and violent events happen we just don't care and go through the same cycle we always do, we never analyze the individual issue itself to make sure it never happens again, we just hear about it, let the news profit off it and most political discussion isn't actual peaceful debate as it is further dividing due to news organizations trying to appeal to certain people and never challenge their views and try to pin the event on petty things like the guy's race, hobbies, even political views or some other petty shit, instead of the mental health issues and or the actual lives the person who did it , and the cycle simply continues.next time a violent event happens, chances are we're just gonna do this same thing. we did it back all the way to shit like columbine. basically, we're slowly becoming a cyberpunk dystopia, and we've become slowly and slowly more like that since about the 50s or 70sthere's a lot more to this than what I said, and personally I don't even agree 100% with what Glover said. I'm personally pro-gun myself and this song seems to have a weee bit of an anti-gun tone, but I'm personally glad overall this song is being given several interpretations and is inspiring heavy discussion. there's been songs with political messages & different interpretations but hell, I think this is probably gonna be the biggest song of the year....or not, and it could just prove Glover's points further about how complacent we are with our country becoming basically a horrifying mix of 1984 and other dystopic novels instead of using the shit Democracy intends us to do and actually fix them ourselves.",1

There is a huge problem within your community. You commit a fuck load of violent crime which leads to a disproportionate amount of interactions with the police. And the few cases of racism get sensationalized. Your culture is the problem. You are diving the country with guilt as the weapon. btw, hispanics are killed at the same rate as black people, a narrative you won't hear much.",1
30561,What the fuck did I just watch lmfao,1
30562,Ummm dem sexy belly dance moves,1
30563,i see a lot of theories in the comments about the symbology of certain shit in the video .. any body have anything on the random cars throughout the video (obviously not the cop cars) and the fact that they are older model Japanese cars as opposed to domestic cars,1
30564,"Being a weird nigga is so much I don't see how you ""cool"" niggas do it.",1
30565,I scrolled down like a lil bit n heard a  gunshot.. shit had me oh shit Gambino ded!? Oh shit! Gambino killin peeps now??,1
30566,This shit is so deep I could have sworn I saw Adele rolling in it... Dope video son!!!,1
30567,3:15 best fucking beat,1
30568,Sounds like another f a g g a y shit in America.,1
30569,so fucking powerful. so much symbolism and  the production in this is great as well. I can't look away,1
30570,This is art and a big ass social critic!,1
30571,"Ha, people call this shit music. All you need to do this is a good camera, a lot of auto tune and some fancy editing. Thumbs down from me.",1
30572,"I've watched this so many times, I find myself doing his dance moves with him. Lando did that shit ONCE AGAINNN. #GiveLandoAnotherGrammy",1
30573,The worst part is that we as Americans are letting shitty politicians run our country into the ground. All the while the news and media distract us from important shit like voting and laws being passed with idiotic tweets from a moron in charge of it all. POTUS is more like pussy of the United States imo.,1
30574,A nigga sings about americ... WTF,1
30575,What an absolute garbage bullshit mess.. trying to be edgy!!,1
30576,This shit is fire holy moly,1
30577,Is that kanye west !!! This nigga childish the goat !!!,1
30578,This is fucking AMAZING,1
30579,Agree or disagree with his message. He's a true artist who is putting together a message in his music instead of just talking about mindless shit and cussing a lot. Respect,1
30580,"Yeah, bring more violence. And shake that fat ass body of yours",1
30581,Wow it sounds like the same shit as all the other unoriginal shit on the radio. These muthafuckers don't even rap no more.,1
30582,Ive seen it like a 100 fucking times. Its a fucking work of art.,1
30583,"IÕm 61 years old. I watched the video, I got some of the references, but I really got them when I watched a British reaction video. Is Trayvon Martins father Really the one  playing the guitar who got shot? I think this is a message to the black man, (Òblack man....get yo money...Ó) that heÕs being fooled and this is how the real world is, but that part applies to all of us. We donÕt join together against anything because weÕre too busy chasing our money, but the system is really corrupt against black people.  . Damn...even  as an old white woman,  I can see how screwed POCs are ( I watch Dear White People.). A couple of people said the guy singing at the end was Thug. I donÕt know who the fuck he  is but he has a nice voice. I heard him sing...ThereÕs a black man runnin....when Glover is hauling ass from what I assume was multiple entities who shoot first and ask questions later...ItÕs an unbelievably progressive video. I just found out about it this morning and I probably already watched it 15 times. You see something new every time you watch it. Death riding on the White horse (Also explained by the Brits.) Wow...just wow....",1
30584,"wow another black blaming whites.....earth shattering.  it's be better art if he focused on the south african rape crisis, or the horrors in the middle east, but no the war on america is on.  what a puppet",1
30585,Propaganda that the mindless drones suck up,1
30586,Dufug dis shit so its ok 2 kill  ppl in a vid fuckn  gay as FUCK,1
30587,"85 mil in a weekYou do that shit in ur sleep",1
30588,Out fucking standing you gotta love this guy Donald Glover is a fucking artist at what he do a born legend. Im starting to see more of the African dancers in American music videos. Great job,1
30589,"I think he's acting like he's mentally ill in the video, hence the church shooting, weird actions and facial expressions, also you see smth like god of death riding a white horse while the police car behind him resembles hell, its like all the dancing and music is distracting you from whats really happening..also when he lit up the joint everthing went quiet..lots of things to see in this video its a fucking masterpiece..Well done. pointed out everything perfectly.",1
30590,Who the fuck asked these gorillas to stay in America. If you donÕt like it- Fucking leave. Blacks make up 13% of the total US population and yet make up 50% of total crimes. Then blacks want to claim racism when they get hurt by the law as a result of their crimes. If you want to act like a gorilla youÕre going to be treated like a gorilla. Go back to Africa and complain about that. There sure is a lot more to actually complain about there. Fuck off,1
30591,100% sure YouTube fucking with like and view count here. IÕve watched several times and itÕs always been unliked and I donÕt think they r showing how much itÕs being played,1
30592,Hes mocking the millenials. With all the shit going in the country they put value on whats trending. Allowing real issues to lie in the shadows. I _ it. We march protest comment on social media then go back to valuing bullshit. There is never any real change.,1
30593,What is with this praise and worship of overly artistic bullshit posing as talent these days? I DON'T get it?,1
30594,"Bro this fucking music I learned a lot listening and watching the clip, I listen to the time and I will listen more, here in Brazil the media also distorts the truth and unfortunately we are not intelligent and we are not attentive to this.beautiful work !!",1
30595,"Without the video this song has no meaning. Is that supposed to represent rap now and days and just America in general for thinking this bullshit is a Ògood songÓ?Edit: IÕm not hating on the meaning of the video or the song, it just has no point lyrically like most mainstream music. I agree with everything in the video but itÕs not a song I would want to blast.  I wasnÕt sure if that was suppose represent something bigger by making a pointless song lyrically",1
30596,this shit reminds me of fela kuti,1
30597,"I donÕt want to be a white person anymore, being judged for being the judgmental race am the monsters chasing gambino..?does every african american (i donÕt think itÕs pc to say black would I call my self caucasian, is that the right term?) feel they must watch their back when surrounded by white people? I donÕt want to be white anymore, seeing the murders in the news what do I do? Talk to Charlemagne and pledge my allegiance against these Òracist ass crackersÓ seems to be better to say that over the air? I donÕt want to be white anymore how do we move forward but still having to make sure we remember the past. Why have we not solved this problem yet I feel sad for the world I donÕt want to be the monster is this how black people feel?",1
30598,This beat is so fuckin tough,1

Kind of stupid about how this song thinks that there is racial discrimination with the police yet, black people are killing 50% of American people for only being 13% of the American population. I mean of course police are gonna come after you. You cant go around killing people willy nilly and think its alright",1

Some kid living in Laos with no food and both his parents killed does not care about your PETTY views.",1
30649,"This is about the contradictions of trying to get money, and the idea of being a black man in America. Fighting violence but being surrounded by it, and gun control. Yes America gets ""Easily"" distracted through media, or songs and its very easy to push different focuses in turn keeping citizens blind to their very existence and surroundings.America needs to focus on its crime, and how people are treating each other, and stop lying on media and using it for distractions and instead inform her people of important events that are relevant. When a crime is committed, its not because they had a gun, they could have made a bomb from home-owned chemicals, or used a knife.. No its the reasoning behind, Why did the person do it? What drove them to it? America however shoves media bullshit and focuses and distracts its people from important matters.",1

30679,fucking genius,1
30680,"This shit is deep af.He's basically talking about how blacks in America are constricted into a racial stereotype that they can't get out of.However, he's also talking about how the black man is involved in its own demise, that THEY are the ones (ultimately), who are responsible for their own downfall that has become systematic and repetitive (illustrated when he shoots the choir at 1:57).The joint he lights up at 2:58 is him illustrating the fact that black Americans need to self-medicate to forget about all their problems. The song all of a sudden becomes up beat and we have the old ""What A Beautiful World"" type feel, where the American media wants the rest of the world to feel like there aren't any problems, even though all that underlying, dark shit is still there and very present.Just my 2 cents about it.",1

30943,"I think I may know the hidden meaning behind this song, if there is any. So here we go:Unlike some people I don't believe Glover was being sarcastic at all. In fact judging by his facial expressions after the shootings he seemed almost depressed and angry.The shootings were quite symbolic. First it was happy music, an old timer enjoying himself with a guitar. A guitar is considered one of the more intelligent and sophisticated instruments despite it's relative simplicity, especially compared to today's musical instruments, which consist almost exclusively of electronic keyboards. It's like the effort is killed. The effort to make good music by using an instrument that requires a certain amount of skill, a certain amount of depth.Second shooting was in university, meaning that composed hard-working young individuals were shot. I think it's important to note that the shooting itself isn't as important as the killing. I think it shows the killing of known ''good'' things. Good music, happiness, and more importantly black college students, who are (not to be racist) rarer than Asians and whites because they are on average slightly less intelligent. In other words the ones that do make it are killed, and I believe he does it himself to show it happens because of black on black crime. Things stay the same for them regardless of the rare few that could make it better, because those rare few are undone by their own kind.Another note is that the old guitarist had a hood covering his head as he was shot, and that he didn't react to wearing it, almost as if he wasn't aware that he wore it. This to me symbolizes blindness, blindness in two ways. He is blind to what's happening, perhaps black on black crime, and he is blind to the fact that he is blind.Then another note is that I absolutely despised the song itself. The beat was bad in my opinion, and the lyrics even worse. There was no diversity in it, just another typical song about how great the artist is. Then I realized that may be precisely what Glover means by it. He kills the good things, the happy man playing a guitar, the happy sophisticated students, and replaces them with generic head-filling pop beats with shitty lyrics. Maybe this symbolizes what's going on these days, and what's been going on for a while, especially after the year 2010.So your thoughts on this guys? I'm not a Gambino fan, but props to him if I've got it right here. Also apologies if I sound like an asshole with some of the things I said, not my intention.",1
30944,Why are blacks so fucking weird,1

No one is outraged about the Drug's, Gun's, and gang's that's taking place in our community, but soon as the police chase and gun one of these savages down ""like towards the end of this video"", you Negros are marching and crying about the injustices in our society.The thug's and savages can kill other Black's in our community and we say nothing because it's ok, but yet we want respect! Everybody is upset over kanye, but no one is understanding his vision.... Far as his 300 Acre's of land to build a community.I'm glad kanye said what needed to be said, and it's a shame that we have to put thing's in ART for people to Grasp!

30980,"There's a lot in this video, here are a few thoughts.Firstly the guitarist takes the seat and begins to play, he could represent the ever-rotating list of pop stars and artists. He is shot and killed by Gambino in a stylish fashion, possibly showing that the guitarist was killed by someone above the lower class that we would associate murder with. This is a possibility to link to the deaths of his fellow artists such as Winehouse, Jackson, Cobain and more recently Avicii. It is further promoted by the fact that at the end of the video, the guitarist is still playing, but with a bag over his head; he is being bled dry for his talent even after his death just like the aforementioned. The line of 'don't catch you slippin' up' and the ironic cultural dancing could show how easily everyone is misled from the truth nowadays - whilst all the crazy shit is happening behind them, the kids are zombified into dancing the way that Gambino is too. On that note, the kids could represent the recent school shootings and also how easily a young mind is brainwashed. Gambino makes constant looks to make sure that the kids are following him - make of that what you will; Gambino is most likely trying to represent that brainwashing the kids into a specific sub-culture and lifestyle is what is trying to be achieved in America. The church scene is a very obvious nod to the church massacres of recent times, and that how good spirited people will die in such attacks in America. Again whilst all the shit is happening around them, Gambino and crew are oblivious to what is around them, and keep on dancing, pretending like nothing has happened. There are kids filming from above, a reference to how everything is logged and recorded in this day and age, and how people will refrain from stopping something bad from happening just to get it on film for a Snap or Insta story. Around this scene are the burning car, evidence of riot, and a pale (white horse), the last of the four horsemen, a representation of the apocalypse that is possible to come, or has already arrived, depending on interpretation. The kids finally run from Gambino when he gets his 'gun' out, even though it is fake. This could be linked to gun control measures and how objects, even your hand, could be interpreted as a gun in the US. Gambino, evidently stressed out, lights a cigarette and climbs on to a red, representing danger, car. The hazard lights on two of the cars are showing, obviously representing warning. The warehouse scene closes out of a TV-like box; possibly representing how everything can be altered and changed by the media to fit a certain script. This is Gambino's take. Gambino is then running from people - it could be from the elites that will not enjoy this representation of the 'land of the free' at all. Is this Gambino trying to tell the world how fucked up the US really is?",1
30981,You call this shit music!,1
30982,This is fucking amazing,1
30983,"The reason I don't like Childish Gambino is because Donald Glover is flexing with it. We got it, you're multitalented like any decent actor and you got some brains and money going and society now  let's you flex in all kind of directions and it's all fine.. but you better get your shit together and work on your magnum opus.

When you look for pain and suffering guess what you find.  Unplug and do good by a few people today, play with a young family member, head out to a place with trees and birds, just do anything that makes you feel good other than constantly shit posting or virtue signaling.

They have to speak up to let those who want to keep this nation divide know that this generation  ( millennials) Don't see racism and they want a nation of quick thinkers and fast leaners. Millennials don't realize they can end all this B.S. the old ass baby booms keep pulling every four years and in between the next election. Sure Kanye said some shit that was irresponsible,but..I really think there is A method to his Maddness. Listen to the new song with Kanye and T.I.  Listen to his lyrics, he not talking about shooting another black person,or money or flash. He making people talk,even if you feel negative on how he is going about it.. he has the Nation Talking and not trying to hide that this nation has a problem. We are a nation of over drugged and full of fear. We are behind in education as a nation,we have a weak power grid, our bridges and streets are bad.

I think about how society functions in my region and my country and how institutional racism has put my close friends in a lot of situations they really can't help because the odds are stacked harder against them. I wish people today valued art as much as I do at least paintings and visual art. But the interesting thing is: Today vs. 600 years ago, *the artist has transformed.* No longer is the focus on paintings and painters focusing in on whats important and beautiful , but also starting revolutions, speaking the soul, and dragging the darkness into the light for everyone to see. These people are still there. One of their names is Gambino. While artist are still speaking out as they did always, the focus has shifted to musicians and entertainers to speak the peoples word and speak it VERY LOUDLY, for everyone to see and hear.

Whether you interpret it as a song about race, gun violence, or any problems in America, it is very controversial and some may feel that by YouTube letting it trend, they are making a statement.

It's the people's fault for letting mentally ill individuals handle guns. I mean, these mass shootings wouldn't happen if those people weren't given guns, or those guns were under the control of people trained enough to use it. Hell, one point people use is that since the Port Arthur Massacre in Australia and the guns laws were changed that there was '0' mass killings. Well, you know how frequently we hear on the news about gang related shootings and illegal firearms being found? Daily. Also, just the other day 7 dead from gunshot inflicted wounds.

31263,"My thoughts on the video. This video was a perfect representation of America. The first showing was America/Gambino killing our culture which is the guy with the guitar. That's y the beat changed as soon as he died. The beat went from a kinda African dance style beat to a modern rap beat that exist in America. The choir getting shot up  represents the church massacare.That I believe that happened last year. Lastly, Gambino dancing was a perfect mask to what was going on In the background. While u was watching him dance u don't notice all the chaos in the background. That's kinda showing how we don't pay attention to all the fucked up shit that's happening in America because it's always something that distracts up from the real problems in America. It can be a new trend or even something deeper as a meaningless sport. THIS IS AMERICA !!!!!!!!!",1

31277,"Lmao this IS NOT America. This IS the NEWS. basic shit like CNN. This is portraying that as Americans the republican side cares more about guns then the people which isn't true at all. The 2nd amendment is a right FOR people to own guns for protection and defense. Stop believing everything you see and realize that's what shitty democratic people want. Also, the ""automatic gunfire"" in the chorus is complete bullshit. Bullshit like this video is what screws everyone over. And the ""police are trippin' now"" line is dumb as hell. Just because one cop is racist doesn't mean they all are. There's a good and bad to everything and you can't just generalize cops as being bad. If you're stopped by a cop do what he says and don't fuck around like running from them or fidgeting with random shit and reaching into pockets or compartments. Lastly so everyone knows white people aren't the only ones that are racist and discriminate so don't act like they're.",1

31321,"Until us black folk quit livin our entire dam lives around tha fact that we are black and our ancestors was slaves and blacks was mistreated for so many years we will never rise above all tha bullshit. Look we must never forget our past but we cant keep waking up everyday with our blackness as the main thing on our brains. Be proud of your Blackness but dont make that the main thing in yo life. Do you think other folk live that way? NO. Look the Indians was fk.ed over real good as we all know. And the Jews was killed by the millions in WWII and they talk bout that less than we talk bout slavery. And yes even whitey was treated like garbage by the royals and that's why so many came to America to start with. None them use their race or color or bad times of they past as a crutch. They dont be blaming everything bad in their lives on their race and be like fk.it. Seriously as long as we keep using that we ain't never gonna rise above it. With that attitude you done lost before you even play the game. I know I'm pissing ya'll off but it's truth. Think about it. Race relations in America is not as bad as the media plays it. At my job I work with whites, mexicans, people from india, brazil, europe, the Caribbean, even a couple middle eastern guys. And we all get along great and we all treat each other respectful. They is always gonna be those people filled with hate doing shootings and all that but serious It's a very small percent of Americans. The majority of Americans get along fine. I live in the south and Im tellin ya that most whites is cool as hell. We are all Americans and that's what we need to be thinkin. Fk.the media and fk.the Gangsta mentality. Most all us blacks whites and whatever is all working class descent folk. It's the rich and not all white people that holds us all down. And it was the rich plantation owners who had slaves not poor white folk. Nowadays most all us no matter our color is livin paycheck to paycheck cuz thats modern day slavery, but thats a whole other subject. But hey here are the 5 rules I follow in my life and it makes all the bs seem a little less fk.ed up.  #1-Keep God in your life.  #2-Family is the most important thing.  #3- Love over Money everytime.  #4- Your word is your bond.  #5- Treat all people with respect. ""Unless they disrespect you then fk.em."" Ya'll please don't hate on me too bad.  _",1

They give you stuff like this to further the cycle and don't want you to band together and think for yourselves. In the 60s, a democrat president said ""I'll have those n*ggers voting democrat for the next 100 years"" and it hasn't changed. Hillary and Bill Clinton destroyed Haiti but gets Beyonc and Jay Z to shuck and jive and y'all fall for it. Wake up black people, this is all a game.",1

31412,"Can't listen to the song without the video. Song sucks on its own, but 100 times better with the video",1
31413,"I think that the song and the video as a whole means that we were just trying to dance and mind our business, blasting some soulful music. Nobody minds it. As soon as he shoots the guitar player, it turns to rap. Rap overtook other genre and spread all these messages about black people collectively, and puts people under the impression that blacks are somehow lower class because of drugs chains and guns, when we aren't. Now people are fighting a fucking race war when we are all humans.  That's why you can't fool yourself, this is America, people will give you a hard time. At the end when he is dancing on the car, the rap and soul merge, which means that he took them e real messages of rap and the heartiness of soul and combined it. Then he just kept on dancing. Then whenever something violent was happening the focus wasn't on it because America has the collective attention span of a 3 year old. They don't care, even when it matters. And when you say something that's real shit, people hunt you to silence you on some lord of the flies shit. That's why you don't mind others and just keep on dancing. To survive, you gotta get yo money.",1

The dancing on this video is super- epic it got me dancing on the floor, it sort of distracted me from what's going on in the background.",1

Focus only on Donald and whatever the fuck he's singing. Then watch it again, except this time don't focus on Donald at all and pay attention to the random shit that's going on in the background. That isn't really random at all. That's the whole point of this video. We pay attention to senseless and pointless bullshit while ignoring the real shit going on in the real world. Society as a whole as been desensitized to the point that we only care about the things at face value. The song is meant to be a distraction. It's meant to be pointless like most music today. To distract you from the violence he's got going on in the background.",1

Then we can talk about "" choice "" ..The video is unique but it would've been so eye opening and more thought provoking , if the ending had people in their everyday uniforms but instead they're zombies , cop zombies , doctor zombies etc chasing gambino. That would've made it 10 times better . Then have his forehead area, he's "" eye ""  lit up like its a flashlight instead in light blue color.. With the zombies having straight red glowing eyes, gambino turns around and they look human but when he returns to focusing on running , they all zombies.  Tv's flickering everywhere and some of the zombies on couches , eating gmo lol...That would've been like oh shit ..to bad this shit bout to just be a trend and then disappear..These dude needs to team up with MIA, maybe kanye ..",1

If anyone needs to have the symbolism explained they are most likely legally blind, it's pretty much 'in your face'.  I don't like the song at all.  But, I can appreciate the message.  This man is extremely talented.  Why are people so caught up with the significance of this video?  To me, it is the very same shit I see on the news everyday.  People talk about it but do nothing...",1
31562,terrible song.. I mean I get he's just trying to get a message through about how quick Americans are to forget about violence so easily and that's true but the fact that they really just put black people only in such a situation when really it should be all colored people. All this Antifa bs is irrelevant. Why say black lives matter when there's fucking Mexicans getting arrested and illegally accused in places like Dallas? People just wanna stick out that bad like stfu. You're not the only person with problems especially the worst problems.,1

31575,"ItÕs funny, this is the kind of video I expected Kanye to make around this time when America is lost. Not to take anything away from Donald because this is some shit he been on. Just a thought that came to mind. Anyways, something that impacted me about the video was how he had the young school kids dancing behind him. As if to say weÕre turning the educated youth into mindless money chasers. ThatÕs one of the many things I picked up from this work of art.",1

If you pay attention to the background itÕs like most of it is people covering shit up and the main thing is that while your distracted by Gambino you miss all the shit thatÕs going on in the background, kinda like how America works we are force fed bullshit to keep us distracted from all this horrible stuff we overlook.",1

This is the type of music that speaks out to us and yeah, we say ""Oh wow, yeah I'm totally with this"" and we post shit saying we all for it but then we go back to our daily lives of trying to live up to this worlds expectations. When will we all really open our eyes and see what this world is doing?",1

You notice there no  police offers coming to the rescue. Because this country economy was built on robbery, innocent minorities being murdered, people being taken advantage of being being slave, America is a very evil country.. clearly physical slavery is over. The New slavery is mentally. The new racism is promoting hate to another race and stopping them from prospering... America is built on money power and respect but we got it  with evil morals.. in the video he's acting like a coon killing his own race copyiing what white supremacy does to us everyday . We need to stop making music that promote violence to are  own people.. and think out of the box.. most minorities are programmed to hate each other.. due to the brainwashing of the media that's made by white supremacy and some corrupt majority  with  racist the government. This video shows if we keep hurting each other especially our own race. We're going to commit genocide eventually. Don't give America what they want.

He wins over the white audience, the cars are cheering and geting wild. Because of Jackson, white people start to accept black people a bit more. They are willing to fuck them now, thats the girl with the hookup blanket sitting on the car. Anything else? No, the equality that you see is just that. They like black entertainment and sex...that's it. It's all just a frame in the end, it's another show.This is a celly, that's a tool. Him, the idiot, only good for entertainment.",1

But when a white person kills a black there will be riots. That shit has to stop.  When blacks care about each others lives so will everyone esle.,1
31869,This is shit,1
31870,fuck boy,1
31871,"The myth of egalitarian liberalism has caused a stone age people to be forced to integrate into an information age society. That is why blacks are unable to live with a people who are by perspective 4000-6000 ahead of them. Just look at any major city that has a large negro population such as Detroit,Rio de Janeiro and Port-au-Prince. They don't have anyone to blame but themselves.",1
31872,"I don't know if anyone has proposed this Theory, but I think that the pants which resemble the Confederate uniform are meant to represent White America while his topless self represents black America in their years of slavery, thus Gambino as a whole is America in its . So the part where he kills the black man at the beginning in his ""Jim Crow pose"" would mean that America (played by Gambino) killed the black man when embracing the Jim Crow laws. And from a historical point of view, the repercussions of the segregation they imposed can still be felt today. That's my take on that part, there's way mush more symbolism in this video, evidence of this man's genius.",1
31873,"So let me understand this: american is racist? right? Yet, blacks are 13% of the population and commit over 50% of the crimes. Yet, black commit crimes against whites 200x more than in reverse. 90% of the killing in the black community (against blacks) is committed by other blacks. Planned Parenthood kills black babies with the hundred thousands, annually. The democrats push to keep the black man blind, deaf, and dumb... dependent on welfare and stay as a victim -- or have a victim mentality. And is that Jim Crow pose? Please tell me who in today's world has experienced anything during that era? Who is alive today that had anything to do with slavery? If you want to keep black people stupid and oppressed with the victim mentality, then keep putting out bullshit like this. I'm white and I'm proud. I am white and I am a republican, a conservative. I'm white and I will not stand by any longer to see this marxist bullshit that is holding not only the black community behind, but keeping our country from advancing. I stand by what is right, and this video is wrong and a total lie! One last thing: is Donald Glover going to talk about how racist and oppressed the black community is in America, as a black man who has succeeded to the top of his career and is making millions? And is he going to make references to South Africa, where there is a white genocide going on?? What is this insanity?? Black people in the US enjoy a higher standard of living than anywhere else in the world. This shit has got to stop!",1

31917,"Yeah.... SO.. He shoots up a bunch of people. Its actually a really good video, and everyone freaking out about ""messages"" and ""deeper meanings""... Fucking smoking a joint and chill assholes and just just enjoy it. I laughed my ass see the choir go down. WHAT! Hilarious, and unexpected.People freaking out forget what it was like when Madonna's ""Like a Prayer"" dropped....... Now THAT was some made up drummed up bs fake controversy I tell ya!OH! And remember Marilyn Manson. Nope. No one does.",1
31918,The song sucks but the video is pretty friggin cool.,1

31923,what type of porn is this,1
31924,What the fuck did I just watch...,1
31925,"I guess I'm like the only person who didn't like this song, as someone who can play multiple intruments self tought and a basic understanding of music theory I really just don't get what makes this song next level shit. It kinda sounds like the same shit being made by everyone now a days, maybe since he is a Glover that is the reason he is so popular,idk. I guess I'm an old fashioned and outdated 27 year old. I wouldn't even have watched it if it was on my feed everyday. But I did. Now I'm gonna go back to playing guitar with you tube backing tracks. Bye bye.",1
31926,Im not sure i see the point of thia video is Donald Glover saying this is how it is in America because there is only two demographics known for  riots murder gun violence looting wide spread choas and thats the black community and the liberals who start riots and burn shit and claim everyone else is a nazi and a terrorist just a little confused i know alot black people who talk about how this country is fucked up but its there own community that is killing themselves,1
31927,Why does music suck so bad now? Are song writers and so called artists just completely out of ideas?? That was 4 minutes I will never get back...,1
31928,Can someone who isn't a twat tell me the message of this song pls?,1
31929,Don't even comment if you only have MAGA fucking bullshit on your sm pages. SMFH.,1

31932,"Sounds to me like he's trying too hard to sound like Kendrick....which may be the point I guess, still it sounds like shit compared to real Kendrick and compared to previous Childish Gambino",1
31933,ohhh shiiiiiiiitson this fucking video right here is number 2 of all time. number 1 is reserved for KANYE WEST: POOPY DI SCOOP cause we all knoe he gon make one,1

31935,"Ps, trending #1 in Australia xxx",1
31936,"OK, honestly, it's bullshit that this is trending at #2 and not at #1. Seriously, do people really give a shit about another crappy Fornite video?",1
31937,All of this shit has consequences. We were all fine 10 years ago. Hell we were somewhat good 5 years ago. You can't go a day without the music industry or tv or anything talking about race. We're living through scary times and at this point I wouldn't be surprised if a big war or something breaks out in the next 25 years. The hip hop industry has gone full out devil mode. Where has the positivity gone ?,1
31938,he just killed every single new ass crack rapper who just mumbles with this one song. That actually has meaning. God damn. Nicely done. Made fucking respect for this dude!,1
31939,This shit is legendary. I'm glad he didn't stop making music __ this is a masterpiece. The beat is ____ the concept is genius and his dancing is priceless! Lol Even tho that part where the kids scatter is sadly true and chilling.. this video is gonna win some awards,1
31940,What the fuck did i just whatch,1
31941,"This is Islam. They kill a bunch of people every day while claiming that Islam promote peace.They negate rape within marriage.They believe that 9yr old girls can be mature enough to bare sexual activities.They claim that all the horrors that some Muslims replicate from their false prophet have nothing to do with Islam while calling the best pattern of conduct.They believe that non-muslims are the worst of creatures while they are the the best of creatures. (Aryan race ?)Etc...",1
31942,Ion even see SZA ass until the 4 time watching this lmao,1
31943,Wtf is this shit,1
31944,"Man, there is just so much here...my fucking face is melting. The scene with the gospel choir, and he bounces in and dances with them for about one second and then abruptly goes cold and gets tossed an AK and ices them, and somebody swathes it in cloth like a holy relic. Fuck.",1
31945,"This is a psyop. Do you feel it stressing you out? That's the point. Mk uTra shit right here.",1
31946,Play this video again but in x0.25 it sounds like some creepy pasta shit,1
31947,"Lyrics are dumb and repetitive, the pantomime ""dancing"" is fucking obnoxious, and the gun play is red meat for the outrage machine.",1
31948,I also feel like it is point a finger at us as Black Americans and how we focus more on the latest dance craze (ex. The Shoot Dance) instead of what's going on all around us...all the while smiling and tap-dancing ourselves into further despair...still shuckinÕ and jivinÕ while wearing big ass smiles.,1
31949,"I understand that the video is a think piece,its suppose to provoke thought,its speaking to the social ills in American soceity,but we jus gonna pretend like childish nt dancing his ass off",1

31959,This nigga is genius,1
31960,my dudes... shit man the meaning behind this video is crazy. Everything is so beautifully portrayed and it scares me now because this IS America...,1
31961,Song sucks but MV sums up everything about US,1
31962,"1:20 that dance move looks like he's fucking the dancers in the background. If he's America, does it mean that america's fucking those who are dancing to it's tune? The lyric ""guns in my area"" might be how they're being made to suffer losses.",1
31963,This shits wack as fuck,1
31964,Why are you still in America is my question? He's clearly apart of the  the problem with that fruity ass pose at 0:52 ______THIS IS AMERICA,1
31965,"1. Make wack ass song, 2. Put random shit in the video... 3. Let people make up thier own meanings and be considered a genius... This is America",1
31966,"Kendrick should have did this, shit would have been 10 time better !!!!",1
31967,Ok. I ain't gonna lie. The video's good and has strong meaning. But everyone's overlooking the fact that the song was fucking trash. LMAO.,1
31968,I low key fuck with the beat tho i feel like its a 21 savage beat.,1
31969,dumb shit,1
31970,The fucking start is hilarious __,1
31971,Yall wonder why kanye callin out radio bc they a political shit bag,1
31972,"Anybody noticed 3:05 the man that supposedly got shit at the beginning is still playing the guitar, like how media manipulates ;)",1
31973,"A track from Death GripsÕ Year of the Snitch drops today and so does this, holy shit whatÕs next?!",1
31974,this is the fucking best,1
31975,I always knew Bino was talented as fuck but this shit is a whole new other level,1
31976,i woke up in the middle of the night to this. fucking worth it man,1
31977,holy shit,1
31978,"nice mind fuck :DIn the end it sounds like YoungThug -  right?!",1
31979,"ive watched it like 20 times, where the fuck did the gun come from in the first scene. i really want to know, he caught me slipping......",1
31980,What... What the fuck was that! There must be like 15 layers of metaphorical memery happening in this video and I must be too ignorant of America to recognise a single one of them...,1
31981,When you see Will fucking it up in this music video YAAAASSSSS!!!!,1
31982,i thought i knew what fucking trash was but this took it to the next level.  this makes me want to kill myself just listen to the shit,1
31983,"wtffuck thes",1
31984,"The imagery and set design is so fucking immaculate and really makes this more than just a ""song"", this is actual fucking art...the layers of symbolism playing off of each other carries so much weight that all anybody has been able to decipher so far is a message about gun control.  There is so much more going on here.Fucking amazing.",1
31985,"What a shit song. He may be trying to make a political statement, but what an impotent statement. Such an uncreative boring piece of shit song. Fuck.. made myself listen to the whole thing because of other people hyping it up.",1
31986,"Nah, Not really like America but this shit makes this bitch money huh? Irony.",1
31987,This video is done in a few long scenes. Bad ass,1
31988,The music in the background sounds like a fucking horror movie - literally getting chills everytime I'm watching this...,1
31989,"Ugh this guy is NOT A GENIUS! Hes a fucking lame ass wannabe entertainer. And why does he always go topless? U aint all that, dude. And he prolly had writers write his dumb song and video. Also none of wut hes talking about is news. Shit is played out. Fuck you donald glover. No talent hack.__",1
31990,The best part is how he says this is America through all of it when all of that was the shit they do in Africa in certain countries  and the dance was pretty similar to.,1
31991,1:55 Holy shit bruh that flick was insane! 10 kills with 1 spray damn,1
31992,"I get that he's trying to send a message and everything, but why the fuck can't he send the message in a way that's not something a 5 year old child could do on accident?Besides the message  ...... There was nothing here. No talent, no nothing ......",1
31993,I fuckin love all the themes and tones in this video/masterpiece. but the one thing that i love the most is the fact that unless you are very perceptive all you see on your first run of the vid is Gambino jamming out then on your second run you REALLY start to notice all the shit/chaos in the background. My point is we only see the parts we want to watch and ignore everything else until we realise what's REALLY going on. Which is usually too late.... this is America,1
31994,"I reckon that there were alot of complaints from people. that this video shouldn't show so much violence and (half) nudity and a man smoking. Because that would be harmful for children. I reckon alot of people are offended by this video. ..You know, the kind of people who are to stupid to actually DO something about the violence in the real world. Because..like I said. They! are against change..",1
31995,This was so deep my head exploded... and gambino is sexy,1
31996,This nigga is tripin tripin like wtf is this nigga on,1
31997,"Damn. I remember watching Donald in Derrick Comedy videos on Youtube over a decade ago, and thinking ""this guy is going places"". Now I feel like that was a massive understatement. Holy shit, this fucking art.",1
31998,This is the realest shit out right now,1
31999,Not fair that Gambio and SZA are retiring...don't leave us with these wack ass artists __,1
32000,Imo the message behind the song is great I love it but the actual song itself is complete shit. Mumbling bullshit with an ear pleasing beat,1
32001,0:53 why he standing like he broke his knee and shit himself at the same time?,1
32002,0:40 when she sucking ya shit crazy,1
32003,0:39 when your uncle busts in your asshole,1
32004,Where are all the other ethnicities of America at? And why is it that when I look up how to have white pride- white supremacy is the third bitch to come up. There's no such thing as white pride unless its racist I guess..,1
32005,The real insight is the fact large amounts of comments will pretend like this is truly woke message... aww fuck it ill just go get some money,1
32006,What'd i just watch? Lol This shit so crazy but lit tho,1
32007,holy fuck no chill from donald,1
32008,This shit go so hard. ______,1
32009,Gambino pulled a Beyonc ÔFormationÕ on us with the surprise visuals! HeÕs definitely  picking up where we wanted Kanye to lead musically and thatÕs what really ironic. This shit is FIRE!!!,1
32010,"That pose he did when he shot the guitar player is from the Jim Crow minstrel, deep shit",1
32011,soooo how tf they make them shots look real because im scared as shit watchin this xD,1
32012,gay as fuck and copied Erykah badu from her vid when she was naked,1
32013,Bruh thereÕs a nigga riding a horse,1
32014,i dont agree with the politics but this song is fucking dank,1
32015,This shit funny as hell,1
32016,"not gunna lie, this song was horse shit LMAO",1
32017,This might be what you want America to be while the rest of us just want the ones like this to get the fuck outta our country. Or just keep shooting each other you're doing a great job promoting that to the youth and making them believe that that's ALL there is. Blacks are not oppressed anymore. Everyone gets the same deal in life and if you wanna be a fuck up that's on YOU!,1
32018,"This nigga is very childish.....Get it?",1
32019,It's been a week and im still obsessed. As a LONG time fan I'm so moved by this and oddly kind of proud of Donald for making such an important and impactful video. I'm so happy that so many more people are seeing him for the creative genius he is. 100+ million views is fucking amazing and people are talking about real issues and bringing shit to light for the people who don't get it. You're doing amazing sweetie.,1
32020,A piece of shit,1
32021,serious shit,1
32022,This song is trash holy fuck,1
32023,itÕs everyday bro is better than this shit and i didnÕt even like that song,1
32024,Where was the part where he says a shit ton of people have gender dysphoria and politics and media are normalizing and supporting it convincing them to mutilate themselves in order to feel better,1
32025,"If all you noticed was the dancing, you're part of the problem, and missed the whole fkn point of the video. The video was literally about all the important shit we miss because we're so focused on the latest trends in dance, Twitter, and hip hop, while there is complete chaos in the background...#wakeup",1
32026,"The entertainment industry is demasculating black men. We have become the thing to watch basically, with our dance moves, music, etc. While the world just sits back and just says yeah yeah nigga just get your money. Ignoring the racial injustice, the prejudice, hate, and violence. We ainÕt no good for to them unless we have entertainment to offer. This is what IÕm getting from this symbolism. Great job from gambino as always.",1
32027,this man is a fucking genius,1
32028,No this isn't a Tupac track this isn't a coolio  track this a real talk Gambino track... and it is fucking amazing,1
32029,on some Beyonce shit,1
32030,ThatÕs just fucking stupid. lol,1
32031,Bino is a mastermind fuck bitches just to pass the time,1
32032,I can already tell this is gonna start some shit,1
32033,2:45 heroin/pill reference? This shit is genius.,1
32034,"So if I'm getting this straight:- Some talented black man playing guitar. Minding his own buisness. Being a genuine good person or whatever.- Enters the nigger. Starts killing for no reason. Acts in an uncivilized way. Can't even be bothered to put on a shirt.- Society starts to crumble all around him because he has no inner self control. More niggers join in on the pillaging and raping of society's corpse.- Acting like monkey is cool yo. Let's destroy instead of build.- As always, it's the inocents that are the ones paying for all this nonesense.- At the end, the nigger is being run out of where ever he was. Wether they are racists that hate blacks or it's a genuine collection of whites and blacks tired of the nigger's bullshit is unknown.Did I get it right?",1
32035,This fucking beat,1
32036,"America was dropped from it's Mommas Ass and came out fucked up ! Now who was Momma ? It's Crooked , Thieving , Killing , Lying ass forefathers ! That were BORN HERE ! NOT IN EUROPE ! HERE ! IN GOOD OLE U.S OF A ! SO STOP BLAIMING EUROPEANS THAT JUST CAME OVER ! , YEAH ! They did violent shit ! But you actually think your forefathers did less ???! And I'm talking about the 30's 40's 50's and the 60's ! And 65 to 75 years back ! America was always that Redhead Step child that sat on the front porch alone and promised to get back some day . I think they day has come !",1
32037,I know thereÕs way more important things in this video but damn gambino can shoot so fucking good,1

32040,"If this song wins Record of the Year at the Grammys, that means 21,ÊThug,ÊBlocboy JB,ÊUncle JxmmiÊ&ÊQuavo all win record of the year.

Stream it, buy it, request it on the radio, turn it into a meme or challenge, do whatever as long as this song dominates the charts and becomes undeniable.",1
32041,What the fuck,1
32042,I liked his dancing but this video was fucking retarded.,1
32043,These kind of videos either it has a way deeper meaning or it's full of shit,1
32044,"This is America..  Don't catch you slippin up..  (Or you'll get some violence)  Look what I'm whippin up (pay attention to MY violence though).  I think the larger point he's making is that America has a violence problem because it has a vanity problem.  And that the irony is that all the violence/vanity just adds up to a people who just pay attention and face reality less and less. So what's the point of all this?   The point?  THIS IS AMERICA!!!  Key Symbolisms:He's happy with shooting the guitar player (gives a fist pump) because he's a rapper and that old shit has to die, because This is America.  He's proudly walking after mowing down the choir because again, it's old music and has to go because This is America.  This is about the violent nature of our economic system. The Jim Crow pose is to illustrate that black entertainers can always get ahead by being a Jumping Jim Crow for the white community to entertain itself.  The pause after he says. ""I got the plug on Oaxaca.  I'm gonna meet you in Blaka!""  He pauses because he realizes how absurd it is that a people that complains about violence entertains itself primarily with violence (turn on your tv).  He smokes weed to cope which is what everyone seems to be doing now.The people only start rioting AFTER the shootings happens (more love of violence to solve problems) and use it as an excuse to rob old cars.  As for old cars, what's with all the talk about Lambos when everybody drives a Toyota?  LOL!  The white horse is about nukes/global warming (in the background somehow).  It's a country built to eat its own children that wonders why it eats (shoots) its own children.",1
32045,"A shit load of anti-white racist blacks blaming America for black on black murder which has nothing to do with white society at all. NEVER HAS!!!! You can thank the LBJ and the NAACP for destroying MLK Jr., Fredrick Douglass, and Harriet Tubman's dream as being equal and free without black on black crime. By the way...all of them were republicans.ÊBe honest,Êif this was such a problem for blacks, don't you think the NAACP would be all over it? Oh, but the NAACP doesn't give a damn because stupid, anti-white, black racists like this douche fag blames whitey so the NAACP can keep the power and keep their own black people modern day slaves because anyone who is not a modern slave knows that THIER AIN'T NO MONEY IN BLACK ON BLACK CRIME so sayeth the NAACP.",1

It gave a voice to the ignorant and arrogant. When jazz and blues died, so did the soul and heart of black communities. This is just bullshit ÒmusicÓ. True example of how low the standards are of today. You would need a IQ of 80 to think there is anything intelligent here lol. White people make it even worse, they glorify any trending artist as if they are too afraid to critique black artists lol. Go back to 94-98Ó and learn about real rap lyricism.

Even the murderers themselves don't get as much attention as the gun does.... Please, since you all know how to change the world for the best and are the smartest people on earth, explain to me why it is liberal media can't get enough of shootings involving high numbers of casualties and modern sporting rifles?

And I saw a weird ass man in black on a horse... tf is that.. And is that end part like what is happening bts with the rappers, who are doing this to run away from the chaos and darkneas or something?",1

Neat. Must be nice swimming in money.3. Once more someone is hiding reality behind flashy subjects. IE the US government has fucked up the medical system to the point where at its biggest fuck up in recent times, mental issues patients had to be released in the streets from the facilities that held them, so here's some gov approved shock therapy, some lobotomy, aaand get lost because they pulled the plug.4. It's funny how easily history is shoved under the rug, IE how the fear of legal, normal, and very much responsible gun owners (the majority in this particular case) has kept the gov in check. The same gov that experimented on entire towns in US back in the day, the same gov that has papers like the Operation Northwoods, aaand so on.5. Thieves, criminals, and so on, they represent, not society, but what the system made of them. You're not born one you're made one.But by all means, let's blame gun owners who defend their homes or have the collecting hobby, or simply want to vent at the range like any other normal person would, but with their passion and pleasure, for which they paid and pay a lot of money.Such a rubbish video, and disappointment in Glover, but i guess all HollyWood fits in one bracket, rapist, bystander with guilt, or rapee. Right? Because we're generalizing.",1

32283,"Where Donald pauses to smoke a blunt has some significance, he is comparing the fears and struggles of African-Americans to what America will eventually have to own up to.Donald becomes like the bystanders he shot earlier (smoking a blunt, dancing on top of cars, blah). And it is made apparent by the melody that was played before the other two shootings. Later he is ""terrified"" of what is in store for him= Fearful Black Americans.The beat switching to Young Thug's verse reaffirms things. Thug speaks as if he is a White-American talking down to minorities. Up to that point tho, he was doing heinous shit that progressively got worse and could be representing the problems of America. And at the end, he is America finally facing the music.",1

32285,"Very thought provoking piece. The artist went no hold bars and went all out not holding back anything that might even be slightly offensive to anyone for any reason. A TRUE freedom of speech and expression with a monotone background of thought provoking imagery. I don't listen to rap anymore as it's just as Kayne has recently stated, just about fucking your bitch, smoking and do stupid dumb shit that just leads you down a bottomless pit of trouble. A lifestyle that is more cultural and idolized then it is in reality. And many suffer today as victims wanting to be like the lyrics in the rap songs.I don't know this man or the true meaning behind everything, the end where he was being chased by all white people was a little worrisome as I don't like continually seeing the generalization of white people being made to look like they are out to kill and hurt black people. That is not true, that is not reality, just like not every black person is a thug or criminal. But who knows what that last part really meant, if anything rather anyone understands it or not, it is very thought provoking and brings to light issues that.... quite frankly.... have been going on FAR to long in America.",1

I'll tell my police buddies that we need to lynch this one over here, oh wait, it's 2018, guess we'll just pay your talentless entitled ass millions of dollars to repeat comedically flat lines on TV, how about running for President next?

It's so desensitizing. Every time he shoots people he hands the gun to someone with a pristine red cloth. Guns are treated with more care than actual black human lives!!

32402,"Meaning of the video:  People of Color experience overt terrorism daily. People of Color are 92% of the global population and all of us are being economically, emotionally and physically terrorized daily by the 8%. Who use our tax payer money to drive the war machine to control people of color. Example, all the mass shootings that are allowed to continue.  White men commit 85% of all domestic terrorism... and Muslims commit only 0.0002% of domestic terrorism. Blacks commit 0 domestic terrorism. But, Trump  says brown people commit all the terrorism. Just a lie. It's like saying, blacks created Jim Crow because of being black????American, Israel and Great Britain... are the largest conveyors of global terrorism and economic terrorism. Not one country is threatening America... not one. America creates Banker wars. The 7 Muslim countries that we are bombing won't use the world bank... that's why we are bombing them. They were self sustainable countries... didn't use our banks. America wants to ban and kickout all people of color... because, we are 92% of the Global population and they don't want you to findout that people of color have all the power. Just stop using money, (instead, barter, share and gift), stop being consumers and move to safer countries that don't kill or rape you.

32427,"The juxtaposition of the two types of music is a very interesting comparison of hard rap glorifying (in some cases illuminating) killings, drugs, and gang violence with lines like ""I'm so dope like yeah"" after murdering the other guy playing the guitar, maybe pointing to a lot of rappers discrediting other black artists who aren't as ""hard"" as them specifically someone like 21savage vs the happier music gracefully overlooking the negative truths that coexist in our society and encouraging the black man to go get his money as it says in the song and other lovey dovey tracks out there from artists like Drake specifically. Both of these styles encompass most of popular african american music right now in america. The end of the song possesses a very eerie vibe reminding me of Get Out and might be a note from Childish Gambino that either way he is terrified to be a black man in America, part of this anxiety maybe coming from the anxiety faced when trying to decide where you belong in society when the culture is so divided along lines of being ""hard"" and street savvy or having a cushy lifestyle with few conflicts, supported by the unsettling vibe the entire music video gives off to someone who hasn't seen it before. Amazing how much art there is in this song and the video and yet it still bumps. Tl;Dr : I fucking love Donald Glover.",1

He is dancing with kids talking about how great he is doing as hey all celebrate and record or emulate him. He then facetiously starts to mock modern chat toppers about selling drugs while being protected and encircled by the kids. Chaos descends around him until his true self is exposed and everyone runs in fear. The j is his escape and puts him back in fantasy land where even the people he killed are helping him celebrate. As sobriety actually takes over we are shown he is forced into running for the wrongs he has committed. You cant shit everywhere and then wonder why everything stinks.",1

There are countries where they will put you in prison in work camps for saying the president is dumb. But it sucks here in the U.S. Right? There are countries where people, and this is not hyperbole, eat each other, where you can walk home and get kidnapped, raped, and murdered because a local warlord is having a shitty day. But it sucks here in the U.S. Right? Childish fucking video. Unless it's intentionally hyperbolic. Then it's pretty clever",1
32527,YÕall niggas stfu yÕall ainÕt gonna do shit but go to work tomorrow morning. Typing all these bs about the state of America on your iPhones. First world problems are entertaining.,1

32534,"No. What you are showing is nigger africa, not America.",1
32535,3:01 Kanye West impression shit was on point lol,1
32536,"this vid is amazing like it shows how America presents itself with gimics and dancing, people seeming to have fun but in reality shit is going down. The corruption with guns, and black lives matter movement, the police brutality. Childish Gambino knew what he was doing God damn. America is built on apperance vs reality America seems to be a great place to live but in reality the gun laws are out dated and safety is being compromised",1
32537,Controversial as fuck __,1
32538,"for the willfully ignorant dumbasses in the comments, this is not about how many black people are murdered, its about how many of the victims that are unjustly murdered are black people, specifically black men. stop trying to act like you care about black lives by spewing shit about black on black murder. we are talking about the innocent lives of black men and women who can't so much as raise a finger before they are assumed to be a ""threat"". and dont try to come at me with ""but he was shoplifting"" ""but but he was acting suspicious"", youre really going to sit there in your chair typing with what little brain power you have and tell me that stealing is grounds for murder? if that were the case, there would be a lot less people in jail and a lot more dead bodies on the street. I can't fathom how you can take a situation like this where young boys are murdered unprovoked, without reason and make this about white people. you guys are disgusting, have some compassion and use your heart a little more and put down all that shit you're pulling out of your ass. if you look at a situation where an armed cop shoots and kills a man with his family or a little boy walking on the street and the first thing you do is try to rationalize and defend the armed cops behavior, you have no soul and i'm scared to be living in a world where people like you exist because the lives of the innocent obviously mean nothing to you",1
32539,Maaan fuck Trumpthgf,1
32540,Powerful shit,1
32541,This is a fucking Master Piece,1
32542,"Fantastic, thank you Mr. Glover. Put down more propaganda and more shit about how such a train wreck of America is. Especially during such a time like this you piece of shit. Dude, how about fucking complaining how fucking awful and racist america is even though majority of black people fucking segregate themselves from everyone else and have such a strong victim-hood mentality. How about you start to promote equality. Showing blacks and whites getting together and loving each other. Not this bullshit. Now, I know that racism still does happen today and it's completely fucked up that it's still happen after so many years. But, the only way to end that shit is to promote peace and brotherhood among races. What I am about to say might be too much to handle but you guys just need to stop talking about it. Another good way to get rid of the racism going on in America is to stop talking about it. This gets rid of the victim-hood card being fucking thrown every god damn chance it gets. Doing this doesn't make the situation better by any means. It makes everything a lot worse. A good step also for you to take since you are so popular and rich. Is to by helping bring up the black communities and helping to stop wide spread gangs and a shit ton of black on black murders that happen all the time. I love your content no matter your political views. But, just stop fucking bringing shit like that up especially in a time like this. Where whites and blacks are so divided. I just hope at least in my life time that racism in America will cease to exist and we will all get along without worrying about each others race.",1

32547,"WOW! I typically scoff at trending videos because it's usually pop bullshit a 3rd grader with too much time on their hands, could come up with. But THIS...was something. First, the African undertones with the music and dancing were brilliant. The replay value is second to none. But most importantly, the truth telling was refreshing but unsettling all at once. It's one of those songs that's definitely going to irk every closet bigot alive. Watch them twist and bend to come up with any reason as to why they hate this song, as they struggle to acknowledge the reality of it. And lastly, not to bring homeboy up, but this video made me think of Kanye West for some reason and for me personally, it makes his antics this past week, look THAT much more foolish.",1
32548,"I like this video, actually I love this video, for some reason I enjoyed the way he moved (the dance that is) that for me was most captivating but when you look at the video again you realize there's more going on than just dancing maybe that's the message here we're too busy looking at things that are not important, real shit is happening in the background. We need to readjust our Focus on what really matters, or maybe I'm just overthinking it. (Good video)",1

32610,"People please read this message. So this is America....  I bet y'all won't do shit about it. That's what this video is showing, our distraction from our current reality which childish is showing us the course of. We're kept in this state of mind of being soooo aware yet you people get entertained by the fact our country is deteriorating. We're all inside the matrix, too lazy and too entertained to give a fuck, because right now, it's not directly affecting you. Stay woke is just a phrase to be cool now cause y'all too afraid to stand up for what's right, and you let people manipulate your minds. Childish is the carrier for this message I just typed out. We all need to grow the fuck up and stop the hate act like we're brothers and sisters and reestablish true faith in the common man. The truth is when we see someone in the street we most likely ignore them, we are anti social, and can't even share the truth with one another. DIVIDE AND CONQUER/ ORDER OUT OF CHAOS. Dude people are getting fucking massacred on the regular now in the US and we aren't fucking doing anything! And y'all don't even know they have actors bullshitting crisis stories at these shootings! Look it up! Shit is deep! Bohemian grove owl is on our 1 dollar bill. Look that up too. Bet you don't know the words under the pyramid on the dollar.

This isn't some partisan slam of ""the other side,"" but a much-needed commentary on our culture as a whole that leaves none blameless in its harsh rebuke. It's honestly a work of art: I've watched the video more times than I can count and I keep finding new symbolism with the help of analysts and Google. Every moment of this video was thought-out and deliberate, and it's staggering the amount of detail and information that they packed in here.Major kudos to Glover for using his fame to put out something like this instead of feeding the machine with more useless noise. Hopefully - with the recognition that it's received - our society will wake the hell up so that we don't find ourselves in that chilling final scene.",1

Seems to me that the clear message is that we all are getting distracted by stupid shit while there's serious shit going on in the world. The only reason it seems to mainly focus on black issues or black culture is because the artist is a black man, so of course his main targets of this message are going to be the people who deal with similar struggles and issues that he does (black people). However, the message is overall for Americans, all of us in this country. Let's stop getting distracted over petty shit and find solutions to our nation's issues. Whether you think that solution is more security in school, or less guns, let's actually do something instead of talking shit all day and ignoring reality.",1

Knowing that there are people dying and all sorts of fucked up shit happening every minute, and you could be next, and there's nothing you can do about it. You just gotta be happy and have fun. Have a good life and distract yourself from that thought.",1

Cobra Kai is good, but I canÕt keep paying for YouTube Red when shit like this goes down on the platform on the regular.

He even says it to the tune of Gucci Gang.At the end of the music video, heÕs running away from the cops after standing completely alone after ruining everything, symbolizing how heÕs made himself into a target for the Òevil policeÓ.And did you notice how all the school kids behind him later start turning into thugs and committing crimes too? That symbolizes how gangsta rappers influence black kids terribly.Gambino isnÕt attacking gun violence or even American values. HeÕs attacking punk ass gangsta rappers.",1

32819,"People donÕt even get the video and just be commenting. This video has nothing to do about black people, yet everything to do about black people in the sense of the America depicted us. The first shooting was done in a Jim Crow stance. If you donÕt know the history of Jim Crow, other than what school has taught you, you should probably look it up. It was a white racist (Jim) in black face (poked fun and called us Crow) who mimicked blacks when the equal but separate law was passed. He mocked because he said blacks werenÕt equal. So thus this was born. To think the laws were made after a Cracker... ItÕs a very important aspect in this visionary #thisisamerica . The children dancing, Gambino dancing... is yes to distract you! Just what white America wants and has been doing to blacks since fucking forever, while important shit happening. Some of those moves, the first were mainly African. MESSAGE! He white horse, death of course, in the Christianity Bible, which America was heavily founded of. The church shooting was recent! By a lil White boy... the cars are a representation of innocent blacks getting killed but the law. All the artist arenÕt in this video by coincidence. White America sees the black man as nothing but entertainment, since forever! They know whatÕs up. Some artist canÕt even do the type of music they want because White America doesnÕt approve. America steadily wants to portray us us as a negative image, while our youth are watching, and getting slain. Yes black on black crime exist.. but this ainÕt about us boo boo. Are you listening to the lyrics? Can half of you even understand Young Thug lol. Do you even know the history and where it all began and how itÕs fucked up because it continues... in its own way in this day and time. Half of you donÕt comprehend the message.",1
32820,"00:00 - 0:52 In the beginning of the music video, the choir singing and the man playing guitar represent traditional African American culture (Gospel and Blues music). When Gambino shoots the man with the guitar, this represents modern party culture ÒkillingÓ traditional culture, since we can hear the choir singing about money and partying. The shooting also alludes to both black on black violence and gun violence, both of which are very prevalent in todayÕs society. Gambino dancing to the music represents how todayÕs young people listen to and enjoy music with little substance, music that glorifies partying and doing drugs. 0:52 Right at 52 seconds into the video, Gambino states that ÒThis Is AmericaÓ. HeÕs commenting that black on black violence, gun violence, and partying and drug culture are heavily present in todayÕs American society.  0:56 Gambino does a celebratory arm thrust after shooting the black man in the chair. This represents how killings and violence are often glorified in todayÕs media and celebrated in gang culture. 0:57 Ð 1:30 Gambino dances as chaos ensues in the background. This symbolizes how we as a people are distracted by pop culture and other relatively unimportant things when we should be paying more attention to the bad things going on in our country. 1:30 Ð 1:40 Gambino and the other dancers dance as young people party and throw cash in the air in the background. This alludes to current pop culture and how itÕs affecting the youth. Pop music and rap songs that glorify having lots of money and partying influence young people to act that way. 1:40 Ð 1:55 The choir sings about getting money, further alluding to the popular trend of current rap songs talking about getting paper/getting cheddar/getting paid/stacking dough, etc. 1:56 Gambino guns down the choir. This refers to the mass shooting that occurred in Charleston, South Carolina back in 2015. A white man walked into a black church with a handgun and gunned down 9 innocent people. Gambino is referencing mass shootings and gun violence here. 2:04 Ð 2:35 Gambino references drug culture (Òlook what IÕm whippinÕ upÓ), materialism (ÒIÕm so fitted, IÕm on GucciÓ), and guns (ÒthatÕs a toolÓ) as being things that distract people from paying attention to the negative events happening in todayÕs society. He and the other dancers dancing once again symbolizes that people are distracted by pop culture trends like drugs and material possessions, trends which keep them from paying attention to real issues. 2:35 Ð 2:44 Gambino again references money (Òhunnid bands hunnid bands hunnid bandsÓ) and drugs (contraband contraband contraband). TheyÕre still dancing, which continues the theme that these things distract people from paying attention to real issues in society.   2:45 Ð 3:00 Gambino stays still and then slowly moves, which symbolizes a death by gun violence (he says ÒblaoÓ right before this). 3:00 Ð 3:08 ÒAmerica, I just checked my following listÓ. The song is stating that people care too much about their social media presence when in reality, serious shit is going on in the streets. 3:08 Ð 3:40 When the choir sings ÒGet your money black manÓ, the song is once again alluding to the fact that Ògetting moneyÓ is a popular topic in the songs that todayÕs youth listen to. Gambino again dances as the choir sings this because heÕs stating that getting money is one of the distractions that keep people from focusing on the real issues in todayÕs society. 3:40 Ð 4:04 Gambino runs away from all the people that were wreaking havoc earlier in the video. I interpret this as him stating that we need to get away from all the chaos and violence thatÕs happening in society, that we need to do something to put an end to it and make a change.",1

32856,So IÕve read the lyrics to this and watched the video multiple times now and the only meaning I can come up with is heÕs asking for reparations for slavery. It looks cool but thereÕs no actual substance. 10/10 would fuck to this beat tho.,1
32857,"So basically what I'm getting from this is that Gambino symbolizes trap rappers, the way he raps in the trap/mumble rap, I'm pretty sure that's it.The killing of the black man playing the guitar and the killing of the choir symbolizes the death of black traditionalism under all of this bullshit today that goes for ""black culture"". Meaning that this nihilistic non-sense are leading these kids into a lifestyle that's going to lead to nothing but downfall of our community. Also the church shooting could have a double meaning about that piece of shit Dylan Roof and the general violence against blacks in America.The kids running behind him and dancing along is obvious. You see the people running around him in what looks like a riot at a point. At the end you see (I don't know if it's the kids of the people from the riot part or booth) him being chased in the dark are the people seeing the bullshit and turning on him.But this video won't change shit. But thanks Donald.",1
32858,This is shit he barely said anything the whole video he always sucked ass at everything he did,1
32859,Dolald is either a fucking genius or he's developing mild schizophrenia,1
32860,"its about America running from their fears And that our society masks gun violence, racism, gang violence, etc. With a fake smile? The line this is america...meaning that all these tragedies, and violence is just the norm in american society? I don't know why people assume its only about racism. I think Donald is trying to portray Americas ignorant and very self destructive attitude to problems that both the media, people and politics of the USA seem to be avoiding. Infact, I believe that's why Donald shot that man in the opening scene so casually, before the body being pulled out of the scene. Donalds dancing is a distraction, and could be symbolic of the media trying to downplay tragedy after tragedy. A recent example of this could be the recent school shooting that happened! I mean what even happened since then?? NOTHING! NOTHING! NOTHING!The media didn't blame the shooting on guns. No. Instead Donald Trump blamed it on VIDEOGAME VIOLENCE!!! Fuck me dead, and slap me silly!  Americans are oblivious. Your literally being manipulated by our leader, the media, social media and any other form of media. The only people who sadly seem to get it, are people like gambino. All of our recent tragedy's the Vegas massacre, the multiple school shootings, the rate of suicides, gang violence, etc. WHY ARE NONE OF THESE ISSUES BEING ADRESSED??? Don't believe that our problems are being are manipulated? Say what happened when the victims of that recent school shooting went to protest change? What happened when they stood before the legal system of america? Ansssssswer!!!!THEY WERE PUSHED ASIDE! And everyone was told porn was the real threat to the american society!!! Not the weapons, not the violence, etc.The line I keep a strap on me, can be symbolic of the fact that its become so bad that people no longer feel safe anymore, not even in schools, where the President wants to arm teachers. But ""this is america, second amendment right?"" FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM!you realise there literally is no such thing as freedom, right? The only people on this planet who have the rights to say they are free, are people like the aboriginals, or secluded tribes that have had no contact with first world humans. To put it simply, we all live in societies where we all seem to be free, but everywhere are fences. If you follow laws, than you are not free. No. You and I are more or less livestock, and all of us are following our Shepard's blindly as our lives mean nothing more than a statistic, that's used to be profited, or for the Shepard to gain more influence, wealth or power over his herd. We are livestock. We are a statistic. We are always being used for profiting the powerful, and those with power will acquire this by deceiving the sheeps, sacrificing the herd, etc",1
32861,Still no one gives a fuck __,1
32862,"Just so you know this song is supposed to symbolise America. Some symbolisms:-Donald is wearing pants from a confederate uniform.-Random executions symbolise gun violence and they are treated after the shooting symbolises that America values guns over lives.-About in the middle of the clip when he is dancing with some others dancers and shit is going crazy in the back symbolises that the news use entertainment to distact you from such events.-His exaggerated dances symbolise old African American stereotypical dances used to ridicule them.I can go on and on but I believe these are the most important.",1

32901,Man this dude is so out of touch. Funny how most of the retards in the comments put so much stock into what artists have to say. How lame. This is almost as shitty and irrelevant as that dumbass Joyner Lucas song 'I'm not racist'.,1
32902,"Alright, this is probably going to be a pretty controversial comment, but how is the video a masterpiece? I'm a Gambino fan, but I wholeheartedly disagree with the video being a masterpiece. Surely, it has strong messages but how come people are saying stuff about opening your eyes and things like that? Surely, the threat and situations are real, but it's like nobody knew what is happening in America and then all out of a sudden everyone's aware as fuck just because of the video. Just my two cents.",1

Yeah, America sucks so bad while youÕre able to benefit here, living in your fancy home with your fancy cars and fancy clothes.",1
32911,"Do you people in the comments have any solutions or are you just going to continue spewing bullshit until we destroy our own country? Media brainwashing has totally consumed us, and I mean from both sides! In reality we donÕt actually all hate each other like you think. We arenÕt all a bunch of racist murderers. You just believe everything youÕre told and expect the world to be some sort of perfect unicorn land where nothing bad happens. Not going to happen. Protect yourself and your family and live your life with a purpose. We canÕt go anywhere if weÕre not moving together in a positive direction.",1

32914,"This is dangerous, you are creating this false narrative that shapes peoples ideology, including black people. It's fear mongering. Black people, your main problem is other black people. There is a huge problem within your community. You commit a fuck load of violent crime which leads to a disproportionate amount of interactions with the police. And the few cases of racism get sensationalized. Your culture is the problem. You are diving the country with guilt as the weapon.",1

32931,"Stop me if IÕm wrong but I think the scenes with the students represent all the ÒtrendyÓ shit everyone in America uses/listens to (that came exactly from black people) and how everyone is obsessed with them yet once something thatÕs a big deal works against black people, the others turn their blind eye. I mostly thought of it like that, how people adopt and are obsessed with things that come from black people but once a tragedy and injustice occurs, they suddenly donÕt care.

Evil America. Making millions off of propaganda that magnifies and feeds off of violence, bad news, and fabricated fear!! These people are in control of the narrative. He's no different than any media mogul or celebrity he is whining about.

32968,Is the church people getting shot supposed to be a trib to when that black guy shot all those white people for being white in the baptist church in Antioch TN? That was so fucked up... Or is it supposed to be representative of the 90% black on black violent crime rate? Or is it that when the populations & demographics are added in the equations white people are 200x more likely to be a victim of black crime than vice versa? (Yes it is actually 200%) the funny thing is everyone already knows this deep down in the depths of their consciousness. The quest for social acceptance & narcissism that exists in culture today has supressed it. But we are still human & no matter how many katy perrys there are telling us its okay to be a shehe chick with a dick wont change that. So sorry yall BUT THIS IS AMERICA!! ____,1

Just to clarify: I know WHY they did it. But I'm wondering HOW they did it. Tech nerd!edit: gosh some of you guys are really really dumb... as if asking this was a stupid question. I know it's a music video you idiots... I am wondering about the technical aspect of it. If you don't know shit about it, keep your comments to yourselves please. Holy fucking God!edit: after looking at that scene for like 50 times I can see that the gun is already in his pants and they put his skin color over it. you see it especially in the last second before he turns (fullscreen).

How about this so called artist sings about affirmative action... This is america...  Or how about south africane genocide or even his own black brothers dieing due to corrupt governments in Africa. Now he just depicts some of the instances of crime in America that are in a minority. If america is so bad then get the fuk out and go to africa. Not only you will not have a shirt you will also lose pants. #ChildishGambino is fake.. Also music and lyrics are trash...,1

There's an Africa proverb that says, essentially, ""don't accept a shirt from a naked person."" This dude *hates* being Black and desperately seeks white approval (just take a gander at his choice of a mate and sadly self-depreciating ""comedy"" acts), yet y'all are too SLEEP to even realize that, despite his high intellect, he's NAKED; a coon to the Nth degree.
